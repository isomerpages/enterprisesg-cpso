## Overview of CPSR
The Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR) requires 33 categories of household electrical, electronic and gas appliances & accessories also known as Controlled Goods, to be tested to specified safety standards, registered with the authority, and affixed with the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore.

Registration of Controlled Goods under the CPSR is based on Certificates of Conformity (CoC) issued by designated third party Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs), or Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) declared by Registered Suppliers.

Once the model of a particular Controlled Good has been registered, it can then be advertised for supply and/or supplied in Singapore.

## What is the SAFETY Mark

The SAFETY Mark helps consumers and suppliers identify registered Controlled Goods. Controlled Goods must carry the SAFETY Mark on the product or the product's packaging. The mark consists of a “safety logo” and the words “SAFETY MARK” in a rectangle on the right. These goods can also be traced with a unique 8-digit registration number to the registrant and the registered models.
