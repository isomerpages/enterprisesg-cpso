<h2>Overview of CPSR</h2>
<p>The Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR) requires
33 categories of household electrical, electronic and gas appliances &amp;
accessories also known as Controlled Goods, to be tested to specified safety
standards, registered with the authority, and affixed with the SAFETY Mark
before they can be sold in Singapore.</p>
<p>Registration of Controlled Goods under the CPSR is based on Certificates
of Conformity (CoC) issued by designated third party Conformity Assessment
Bodies (CABs), or Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) declared
by Registered Suppliers.</p>
<p>Once the model of a particular Controlled Good has been registered, it
can then be advertised for supply and/or supplied in Singapore.</p>

<p>The SAFETY Mark helps consumers and suppliers identify registered Controlled
Goods. Controlled Goods must carry the SAFETY Mark on the product or the
product's packaging. The mark consists of a “safety logo” and the words
“SAFETY MARK” in a rectangle on the right. These goods can also be traced
with a unique 8-digit registration number to the registrant and the registered
models.</p>
