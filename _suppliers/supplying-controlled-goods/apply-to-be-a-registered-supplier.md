<h2>Supplying Controlled Goods</h2>
<p>No party shall be allowed to advertise for the purpose of supply and/or
supply Controlled Goods unless they have been registered with the authority.
Registered Suppliers are responsible for the safety and compliance of Controlled
Goods registered under their name. The registration will be withdrawn when
the party registered as the ‘Registered Supplier’ ceases to supply the
Controlled Goods registered by it, for instances, where it ceases to carry
on such business or is no longer registered with the Accounting &amp; Corporate
Regulatory Authority (ACRA).</p>
<p>If you are an importer, or parallel importer, retailer or manufacturer
importing and selling anything that has been listed as Controlled Goods,
you will generally need to register the goods. For more details on parties
that need to apply to be a Registered Supplier, refer to Chapter 5 of our
information booklet <a href="/files/cps-info-booklet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that when a company (Registered Supplier) transfers ownership of
its registered Controlled Goods to another business, the new company has
to apply to be a Registered Supplier and re-register the goods with the
Consumer Product Safety Office. In such cases, the former Registered Supplier
must submit an authorisation letter to the Consumer Product Safety Office
before the new Registered Supplier can be re-register the Controlled Goods.</p>
<p>To register as a Registered Supplier, ensure your Corppass access to our
Consumer Product Safety and Accuracy+ system has been setup (the e-service
name is CPSAPLUS). Registration will be immediate if UEN and Corppass are
valid. Thereafter, go to <a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPSA+</a> and click "Log in via Corppass".</p>
<p>A register of Registered Suppliers is also available on <a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/Homepage/RegisterofRegisteredSuppliers" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPSA+</a> 'Register
of Registered Suppliers'.</p>
