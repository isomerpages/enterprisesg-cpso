## Supplying Controlled Goods
No party shall be allowed to advertise for the purpose of supply and/or supply Controlled Goods unless they have been registered with the authority. Registered Suppliers are responsible for the safety and compliance of Controlled Goods registered under their name. The registration will be withdrawn when the party registered as the ‘Registered Supplier’ ceases to supply the Controlled Goods registered by it, for instances, where it ceases to carry on such business or is no longer registered with the Accounting &amp; Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA).

If you are an importer, or parallel importer, retailer or manufacturer importing and selling anything that has been listed as Controlled Goods, you will generally need to register the goods. For more details on parties that need to apply to be a Registered Supplier, refer to Chapter 5 of our information booklet <a href="/images/cpsr-resources/cps-info-booklet.pdf">here.</a>{:target="_blank"}

Note that when a company (Registered Supplier) transfers ownership of its registered Controlled Goods to another business, the new company has to apply to be a Registered Supplier and re-register the goods with the Consumer Product Safety Office. In such cases, the former Registered Supplier must submit an authorisation letter to the Consumer Product Safety Office before the new Registered Supplier can be re-register the Controlled Goods.

To register as a Registered Supplier, ensure your Corppass access to our Consumer Product Safety and Accuracy+ system has been setup (the e-service name is CPSAPLUS). Registration will be immediate if UEN and Corppass are valid. Thereafter, go to [CPSA+](https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg) and click "Log in via Corppass".

A register of Registered Suppliers is also available on [CPSA+](https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/Homepage/RegisterofRegisteredSuppliers) 'Register of Registered Suppliers'.
