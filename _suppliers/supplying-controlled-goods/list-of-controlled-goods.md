<h2>33 Categories of Controlled Goods</h2>
<p>The 33 categories of Controlled Goods (CGs) under CPSR are tiered into
<a href="#bottom_low" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Low</a>, <a href="#bottom_medium" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Medium</a> and
<a href="#bottom_high" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">High</a>Risk CGs that have different conformity assessment approaches.</p>
<p>For registration of low risk CGs, the Registered Supplier will have to
submit a Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity to the Consumer Product Safety
Office. For medium and high risk CGs, a Certificate of Conformity issued
by a <a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/list-of-cps-cab" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Designated Conformity Assessment Body</a> is
required for registration of the CG. Click to find out more about <a href="/suppliers/cpsr/register-your-controlled-goods" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">registering CGs.</a>
</p>
<p>Suppliers must first apply to be a Registered Supplier before supplying
these Controlled Goods. Click to find out more on how to <a href="/suppliers/cpsr/apply-to-be-a-registered-supplier" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">apply as a Registered Supplier.</a>
