<h2>Register your Controlled Goods</h2>
<p>For registration of the Controlled Goods, Registered Suppliers (RS) need
to first obtain the necessary test reports for their products, showing
compliance to the relevant safety standards.</p>
<p>You may refer to Chapter<strong> 4.1</strong> of our information booklet
<a href="/files/cps-info-booklet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>for the list of applicable safety standards for each category
of Controlled Good, Chapter <strong>4.2 </strong>for the additional safety
requirements specified by the Consumer Product Safety Office for Controlled
Goods, and Chapter <strong>5.3</strong> for the types of acceptable test
reports.</p>
<p><strong>For Low Risk CGs:</strong>
<br>The RS can submit a Supplierâ€™s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) to the
Consumer Product Safety Office. In doing so the RS is making a self-declaration
that the low risk CGs conform to the requirements of CPSR.</p>
<p><strong>For Medium and High Risk CGs:</strong>
<br>The RS submits test reports and other relevant documentation to a Conformity
Assessment Body (Certification) for review. If the Controlled Goods meets
the safety requirements, the CAB (Certification) issues a Certificate of
Conformity (CoC) and submits the CoC to the Consumer Product Safety Office.</p>
<p>If submitted documents are in order, a Letter of Approval (LOA) will be
issued to the RS within 1 working day.</p>
