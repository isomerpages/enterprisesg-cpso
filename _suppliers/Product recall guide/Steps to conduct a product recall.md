<h3>Steps to conduct a Product Recall</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Incident notification &amp; investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>•Suppliers should put in place a system for collecting information on
product incidents and communication with stakeholders.</p>
<p>•Suppliers should notify the CPSO when they become aware of incidents
involving their product which may lead to a recall, e.g. when there are
serious or multiple injuries.</p>
<p>•Suppliers should establish a process for investigating product incidents
or potential incidents.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Assessing the need for product recall</strong>
</p>
<p>•Suppliers should establish a process for assessing the risk of harm.</p>
<p>•Suppliers should leverage on systems and processes to trace the affected
batches of products. Information captured should clearly identify the product.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Implementation of Product Recall</strong>
</p>
<p>•When the decision is made that a product recall is necessary, the supplier
should inform the relevant stakeholders in the supply chain.</p>
<p>•Suppliers should also inform the CPSO of the intended product recall
prior to enacting the recall.</p>
<p>•Suppliers may include a <a href="/files/product-safety-alerts-and-recalls/recall-action-plan-template-26092024.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Recall Action Plan (RAP)</a> for
added information when notifying the CPSO of the product recall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Progress Reporting</strong>
</p>
<p>•After initiation of the product recall, the progress of the recall should
be carefully monitored to ensure that it is effective and achieves its
objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•Suppliers should report the progress to the CPSO, at an agreed-upon frequency.
Suppliers may follow the <a href="/files/product-safety-alerts-and-recalls/recall-progress-report-template-2692024.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Recall Progress Report template</a>.</p>
<p>•It is important to evaluate the effectiveness of the recall continually
in order to ensure that objectives are being met, and if necessary to adjust
the Recall Action Plan to improve the recall effectiveness.</p>
<p>•Suppliers may also consider to review their communication strategy and
improve the ease of response for affected consumers.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Recall Closure</strong>
</p>
<p>•Before the active recall operation ceases, suppliers should evaluate
if the recall objectives have been met.</p>
<p>•Note: Suppliers are to ensure that consumers should be able to return
the affected product at all times. The supplier should therefore continue
to provide capability to receive products that are subject to recall, even
if the active recall operation has concluded.</p>
