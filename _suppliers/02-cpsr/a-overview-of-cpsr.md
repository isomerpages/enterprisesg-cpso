## Overview
The Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR) requires 33 categories of household products, also known as Controlled Goods, to be registered with the authority. These products need to be tested to specified safety standards and affixed with the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore.

Registration of Controlled Goods under the CPSR is based on Certificates of Conformity (CoC) issued by designated third party Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs), or Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) declared by Registered Suppliers.

Once the model has been registered, the Controlled Goods can then be advertised for supply and/or supplied in Singapore.

## What is the SAFETY Mark

The SAFETY Mark helps consumers and suppliers identify registered Controlled Goods. These goods must carry the SAFETY Mark on the product. The mark consists of a “safety logo” and the words “SAFETY MARK” in a rectangle on the right. These goods can also be traced with a unique 8-digit registration number to the registrant and the registered models. 

The SAFETY Mark can either be affixed on the Controlled Goods or their packaging (to be affixed in a prominent location).

You may check the validity of the product's SAFETY Mark in 3 easy steps:
