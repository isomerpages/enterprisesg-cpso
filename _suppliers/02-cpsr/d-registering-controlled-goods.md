## Registering Controlled Goods
The 33 categories of Controlled Goods (CGs) under CPSR are tiered into Low, Medium and High Risk CGs based on XXX.

**For Low Risk CGs:**<br>
The Registerd Supplier (RS) can submit a Supplierâ€™s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) to the Consumer Product Safety Office. In doing so the RS is making a self-declaration that the low risk CGs conform to the requirements of CPSR.

**For Medium and High Risk CGs:**<br>
The Registered Supplier submits test reports and other relevant documentation to a Conformity Assessmebt Body (Certification) for review. If the CGs meet safety requirements, the CAB (Certification) issues a Certificate of Conformity (CoC) and submits the CoC to the Consumer Product Safety Office.  

If the Consumer Product Safety Office judges that the application is in order, a Letter of Approval (LOA) will be issued to the RS.
