## Registering Controlled Goods
For registration of the Controlled Goods, Registered Suppliers (RS) need to first obtain the necessary test reports for their products, showing compliance to the relevant safety standards.

You may refer to Chapter 6 of our information booklet <a href="/images/cpsr-resources/cps-infobooklet.pdf/">here</a>{:target="_blank"} for the list of applicable safety standards for each category of Controlled Good, and Chapter 9 for the types of acceptable test reports. 

**For Low Risk CGs:**<br>
The RS can submit a Supplierâ€™s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) to the Consumer Product Safety Office. In doing so the RS is making a self-declaration that the low risk CGs conform to the requirements of CPSR. 

**For Medium and High Risk CGs:**<br>
The RS submits test reports and other relevant documentation to a Conformity Assessment Body (Certification) for review. If the CGs meets safety requirements, the CAB (Certification) issues a Certificate of Conformity (CoC) and submits the CoC to the Consumer Product Safety Office. 

If the Consumer Product Safety Office deems the application is in order, a Letter of Approval (LOA) will be issued to the RS.

You may refer to Chapters 9 and 10 of our information booklet <a href="/images/cpsr-resources/cps-infobooklet.pdf/">here</a>{:target="_blank"} and our [Resource page](/suppliers/cpsr/resources) for more information on registering controlled goods.
