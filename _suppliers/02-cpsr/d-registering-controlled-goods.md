## Registering Controlled Goods
The 33 categories of Controlled Goods (CGs) under CPSR are tiered into Low, Medium and High Risk CGs based on.. (rationale and benefit). 
**For Low Risk CGs:**<br>
The Registerd Supplier (RS) can submit a Supplierâ€™s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) to the Consumer Product Safety Office. In doing so the RS is making a self-declaration that the low risk CGs conform to the requirements of CPSR. 

**For Medium and High Risk CGs:**<br>
The Registered Supplier submits test reports and other relevant documentation to a Conformity Assessmebt Body (Certification) for review. If the CGs meet safety requirements, the CAB (Certification) issues a Certificate of Conformity (CoC) and submits the CoC to the Consumer Product Safety Office. For more details, refer to our

If the Consumer Product Safety Office deems the application is in order, a Letter of Approval (LOA) will be issued to the RS.

You may refer to Chapter 9 and 10 of our information booklet [here] for more information on registering controlled goods.
