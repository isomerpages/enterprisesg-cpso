<p><strong>Step 1: Incident notification &amp; investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>•Suppliers should put in place a system for collecting information on
product incidents and communication with stakeholders.</p>
<p>•Suppliers should notify the CPSO when they become aware of incidents
involving their product which may lead to a recall, e.g. when there are
serious or multiple injuries.</p>
<p>•Suppliers should establish a process for investigating product incidents
or potential incidents.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Assessing the need for product recall</strong>
</p>
<p>•Suppliers should establish a process for assessing the risk of harm.</p>
<p>•Suppliers should leverage on systems and processes to trace the affected
batches of products. Information captured should clearly identify the product.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Implementation of Product Recall</strong>
</p>
<p>•When the decision is made that a product recall is necessary, the supplier
should inform the relevant stakeholders in the supply chain.</p>
<p>•Suppliers should also inform the CPSO of the intended product recall
prior to enacting the recall.</p>
<p>•Suppliers may include a <u>Recall Action Plan (RAP)</u> for added information
when notifying the CPSO of the product recall.</p>
