## Be a Responsible Supplier
Suppliers have the prime responsibility to ensure they sell safe products. They must comply with the relevant product safety regulations and ensure their products do not pose a safety risk to consumers.

**Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR)**<br>
Suppliers must comply with the CPSR to ensure that the electrical, electronic and gas products you supply meet relevant safety standards and are affixed with the SAFETY Mark.

Any person found guilty of selling unregistered Controlled Goods, is liable upon conviction, to a fine not exceeding S$10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both.

**Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR)**<br>
Suppliers must comply with the CGSR and ensure the consumer goods you supply meet relevant safety standards.

If consumer goods do not meet applicable safety standards, suppliers will be required to stop the sale of these goods in the market. We will also direct suppliers to inform users of the potential dangers of such goods. The penalty for non-compliance is a fine and/or imprisonment.
