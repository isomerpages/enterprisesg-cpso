<h2>Overview of CGSR</h2>
<p>The Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations
2011 (<strong>CGSR</strong>) aims to protect consumers from unsafe general
consumer goods such as toys, children’s products, apparel, sports and recreation
products, furniture, mattresses and bedding and DIY tools.</p>
<p>General consumer goods covered by the CGSR must comply with <strong>A and B</strong> below:</p>
<p><strong>A. <u>At least one</u> of the applicable safety standards by any of the following organisations:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>International Organization for Standardization (ISO);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>European Committee for Standardisation (EN); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ASTM International;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>and</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong>  <strong>The additional safety requirements in section 5.2 of the <a href="/files/cgsr-info-book.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CGSR Information Booklet</a>.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regional or national standards may also be accepted for consumer goods
that do not have applicable international safety standards.</p>
<p>Please refer to section 5.1 (<strong>pages 9 – 12)</strong> of the <a href="/files/cgsr-info-book.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CGSR Information Booklet</a> for
a <u>non-exhaustive</u> list of common general consumer goods and their applicable
safety standards.</p>
<p>The &nbsp;CPSO does active post-market surveillance to reduce the impact
of unsafe general consumer goods. When general consumer goods that do not
meet applicable safety standards and requirements are detected, the CPSO
can direct suppliers to stop the sale of these goods in the market and
inform users of the potential dangers of such goods. The penalty for non-compliance
is a fine and/or imprisonment.</p>
<h4><strong>Who should know the CGSR?</strong></h4>
<p>Suppliers of consumer goods (this includes manufacturers, importers, distributors,
retailers and other traders) should sell only safe goods.</p>
<p>Suppliers can enhance the safety of their products by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ensuring that their products have been tested and/or certified to applicable
safety standards by an accredited laboratory. For a list of laboratories
accredited by the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) and their relevant
testing scope(s), please visit the SAC’s database at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://sacinet2.enterprisesg.gov.sg/sacsearch/search</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checking their products for safety problems or defects before sale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing warnings to consumers on potential hazards or risks associated
with the use of the product</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplying unsafe goods may result in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Loss of company reputation and consumer confidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costs incurred to resolve the issue, such as the removal of goods from
the market and/or replacement of products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Penalties and fines</p>
</li>
</ul>
