**Brompton P Line Wheel Nut Corrective Action - To replace the Wheel Nut on affected P Line model bicycles (those with a serial number lower than 2203113405)**<br>

Brompton, the supplier of commuter/urban bikes issued a notice for some of their P Line bikes. During their quality control testing, they found possible damage to the thread of the front wheel nut during installation on some bikes, which could lead to the nut becoming loose and potentially shaking off during cycling.

So far, there have been no reported incidents of this happening to any P Line owners.

Bikes which may be affected are P Line models with a serial number lower than 2203113405. P Lines with a serial number higher than 2203113405 are not affected.

The A, C, T Lines, and Superlight bikes are not affected.

Customers can find the P Line bike's serial number on the rear of your seat tube post.
