 ## Type of Mains Plugs Suitable for use in Singapore
Apart from Brunei, Hong Kong, Malaysia or UK, mains plugs that are used in other countries are different from those intended for use in Singapore. It is important to ensure that the correct plug is used with a local wall socket to avoid hazards such as fires and electrocution.

**3 types of mains plugs suitable for use in Singapore**

|---|---|
|![mains plugs 1](/images/consumers/did-you-know/types-of-mains-plugs-1.jpg)|**(1) The 2.5AMP 2 round-pin mains plug** – This is generally used for electronics appliances such as TV, DVD and audio sets. These appliances do not rely on the ‘Earth’ wire for protection from a short circuit and therefore only 2 pins are needed – one for the ‘Live’ wire and the other for the ‘Neutral’ wire.|
|![mains plugs 2](/images/consumers/did-you-know/types-of-mains-plugs-2.jpg)|**(2) The 13AMP 3 pin fused mains plug** – This is used for electrical appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and microwave ovens. These appliances have a metal body which must be grounded so that in the event of a short circuit, there is no risk of electrocution to the user.|
