## Controlled Goods Must have the SAFETY Mark
The Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR) requires 33 categories of household products, also known as Controlled Goods, to be registered with the Consumer Product Safety Office. These products need to be tested to specified safety standards and affixed with the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore. These include testing for safety measures against fire, electric shock, explosion, radiation and other hazards that could result in injury, death or property damage.

Consumers are strongly advised to buy only Controlled Goods that are affixed with the SAFETY Mark.
