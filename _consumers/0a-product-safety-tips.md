## Controlled Goods Must have the SAFETY Mark
The Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR) requires 33 categories of household products, also known as Controlled Goods, to be registered with the Consumer Product Safety Office. These products need to be tested to specified safety standards and affixed with the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore. These include testing for safety measures against fire, electric shock, explosion, **radiation** and other hazards that could result in injury, death or property damage.

Consumers are strongly advised to buy only Controlled Goods that are affixed with the SAFETY Mark.

## Keep your family safe from injuries with the SAFETY Mark
When purchasing new appliances, it is important to keep safety considerations in mind and not base purchase decisions solely around cost and aesthetics. Protect your family by purchasing products carrying the SAFETY Mark.

Household gas and electrical appliances posing higher potential hazards to their consumers are required by law to be affixed with a valid SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore.

Examples of these hazards can include:
