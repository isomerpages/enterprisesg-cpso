## General Consumer Goods
Consumer goods such as toys, childrenâ€™s products, apparel, sports and recreation products, furniture, mattresses and bedding and DIY tools fall under the Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR). Consumer goods under CGSR are not required to be registered with the authority. However, they must meet any of the following international safety standards:

* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
* International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
* European Committee for Standardisation
* ASTM International

Regional or national standards may also be accepted for consumer goods that do not have applicable international safety standards.

The Consumer Product Safety Office does active post-market surveillance to reduce the impact of unsafe general consumer goods as soon as safety issues are discovered. Consumers may also refer to the [Product Safety Alerts and Recalls](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/quality-standards/consumer-protection/for-consumers/product-safety-alerts-and-recalls){:target="_blank"} for the latest news regarding unsafe consumer products identified in Singapore.
