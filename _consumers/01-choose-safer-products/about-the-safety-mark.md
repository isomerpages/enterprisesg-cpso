## Controlled Goods Must have the SAFETY Mark
The Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR) requires 33 categories of household products, also known as Controlled Goods, to be registered with the Consumer Product Safety Office. These products need to be tested to specified safety standards and affixed with the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore. These include testing for safety measures against fire, electric shock, explosion, **radiation** and other hazards that could result in injury, death or property damage.

Consumers are strongly advised to buy only Controlled Goods that are affixed with the SAFETY Mark.

## What is the SAFETY Mark?
The SAFETY Mark helps consumers and suppliers identify registered Controlled Goods. These goods must carry the SAFETY Mark either affixed on the Controlled Goods or their packaging (to be affixed in a prominent location). The mark consists of a “safety logo” and the words “SAFETY MARK” in a rectangle on the right. These goods can also be traced with a unique 8-digit registration number to the registrant and the registered models.

**Why should you insist on the SAFETY Mark?**<br>
The SAFETY Mark indicates that the products’ design has been tested and certified to be compliant with the relevant safety standards. For most appliance categories, the presence of the SAFETY Mark also indicates that internal safeguards have been incorporated to protect against fire and electrical hazards.
