Consumers can do their part in keeping their families safe by bearing in mind the following pointers:

**Household electrical, electronic and gas appliances and accessories**

- 33 categories of household electrical, electronic and gas appliances and accessories are classified under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations as Controlled Goods. They are required to be registered with Enterprise Singapore and affixed with the SAFETY Mark on the product or packaging before they can be sold in Singapore. Examples of Controlled Goods are kettles, water heaters, televisions, microwave ovens, portable 3-pin socket-outlets and fans.

- Check if the SAFETY Mark on the product is valid by entering either the model number or the 8-digit registration number into Enterprise Singaporeâ€™s Register of Registered Controlled Goods.

- When buying electrical appliances and electronic goods, check the voltage rating label on them to ensure that they are suitable for local use. The mains sockets in Singapore supply 230V. Also, ensure that the appliance comes with appropriate mains plug:
  - 13A and 15A 3-pin mains plugs that have been registered with Enterprise Singapore and are affixed with the SAFETY Mark
  - 2.5A 2-pin mains plugs
