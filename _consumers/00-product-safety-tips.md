### Choose Safer Products, Use Products Safely
Consumers can do their part in keeping their families safe by bearing in mind the following pointers:

**Household electrical, electronic and gas appliances and accessories**

* 33 categories of household electrical, electronic and gas appliances and accessories are classified under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations as Controlled Goods. They are required to be registered with Enterprise Singapore and affixed with the SAFETY Mark on the product or packaging before they can be sold in Singapore. Examples of Controlled Goods are kettles, water heaters, televisions, microwave ovens, portable 3-pin socket-outlets and fans.

* Check if the SAFETY Mark on the product is valid by entering either the model number or the 8-digit registration number into Enterprise Singapore’s Register of Registered Controlled Goods.

* When buying electrical appliances and electronic goods, check the voltage rating label on them to ensure that they are suitable for local use. The mains sockets in Singapore supply 230V. Also, ensure that the appliance comes with appropriate mains plug:
  - 13A and 15A 3-pin mains plugs that have been registered with Enterprise Singapore and are affixed with the SAFETY Mark
  - 2.5A 2-pin mains plugs

**General consumer goods**

*	Avoid making your decision to purchase any item solely based on price. Product safety is of equal importance in the consideration process.
*	Research on the type of product you want to buy and gather tips on what to look out for.
*	Check the product description, its functions and age recommendation for the product you are buying.
*	Buy from reputable retailers and when making an online purchase, check if the product meets safety standards and is suitable for local use.
*	Check if the product comes with instructions and manufacturer/distributor information.
*	Inspect the product you are buying for any damage. Look out for sharp edges as well as loose or missing parts.

**Use products safely**

*	Read safety warnings and instructions on assembly, installation, usage and maintenance. Follow them strictly.
*	Use products only for their intended purpose
*	Do not make assumptions on how to use a product just because you have used a similar product in the past. Always refer to the safety information supplied.
*	Ask the seller for help if the product’s intended use or instructions are not clear.
*	Assess if children need to be supervised when using a product.
*	Assess if you need to keep a product out of the reach of young children.
*	Stop using product when signs of wear and tear such as cracks are observed.
*	Do not use electrical appliances near wet areas and bathtubs, basins or other vessels containing water.
