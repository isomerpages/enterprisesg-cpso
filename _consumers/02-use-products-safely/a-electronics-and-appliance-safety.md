  <summary><b>Safety Tips on Button Batteries</b></summary>
<p>Parents and caregivers must be aware of the dangers that button batteries can pose to young children. These batteries are found in many common household devices like remote controls, toys and flashlights. They should be kept out of the reach of small children as they may be accidentally swallowed or inserted into their ears or noses. Parents should get medical help fast if these batteries are swallowed as they can get stuck in the throat and cause severe burns.</p>

<p>According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the coin-sized lithium button batteries can lodge in the throats of children, where saliva immediately triggers an electrical current, causing a chemical reaction that can severely burn through the oesophagus in as little as two hours.</p>

<p>Button batteries are found in devices such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remote controls</li>
  <li>Electric toys</li>
  <li>Calculators</li>
  <li>Watches</li>
  <li>Bathroom scales</li>
  <li>Reading lights</li>
  <li>Flameless candles</li>
  <li>Flashlights</li>
  <li>Talking and singing books and greeting cards</li>

  <summary><b>Safety Tips on Hair Straighteners</b></summary>
<p>Hair straighteners generate high heat which can be applied to hair to smoothen out tangles. It is important to know that the heat generated can reach temperatures exceeding 200°C. While they heat up rapidly, a considerable amount of time is needed for the appliance to cool down after use. If they are not put away safely during the cooling down process, there is a risk of contact burns from the hot plates when young children pick them up. This could result in injuries ranging from the superficial to the severe.</p>

<p>Keep your family safe – follow these safety guidelines and exercise caution when using hair straighteners:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Only purchase hair straighteners bearing the SAFETY Mark. The SAFETY Mark indicates that the product model has been tested to specific safety standards, and also carries a unique certification number traceable to the supplier.</li>
  <li>Switch off hair straighteners immediately after use. Do not leave it running unattended.</li>
  <li>Keep hair straighteners out of reach of children while waiting for the plates to cool down.</li>
  <li>Store them in a safe place immediately after the plates have cooled down. If possible, place them in a special heat resistant pouch.</li>
  <li>Do not use electrical appliances near bathtubs, basins or other vessels containing water.</li>
</ul>
