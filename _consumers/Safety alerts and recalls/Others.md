The lot codes of the recalled products begin with the letters F, H and T and the last four digits are numbered or less than 9354, 2262 and 5264, respectively.

These products can contain bacteria. People with weakened immune systems, external medical devices and underlying lung conditions who are exposed to the bacteria face a risk of serious infection that may require medical treatment. The bacteria can enter the body if inhaled, or through the eyes or a break in the skin. People with healthy immune systems are usually not affected by the bacteria.
