<h2>Products that do not require a SAFETY Mark</h2>
<p>Consumer goods such as toys, children’s products, apparel, sports and
recreation products, furniture, mattresses and bedding and DIY tools, which
are not regulated under other product safety Regulations, fall under the
Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR).
Consumer goods under the CGSR do not require pre-market approval by the
authority. However, they must comply with international safety standards
such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>European Committee for Standardisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ASTM International</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regional or national standards may also be accepted for consumer goods
that do not have applicable international safety standards.</p>
<p>The Consumer Product Safety Office does active post-market surveillance
to reduce the impact of unsafe general consumer goods as soon as safety
issues are discovered. Consumers may refer to the <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/consumers/safety-alerts-and-recalls/children-apparel/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Product Safety Alerts and Recalls page</a> for
the latest news regarding unsafe consumer products identified in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>When purchasing consumer goods, consumers are encouraged to:</strong>
