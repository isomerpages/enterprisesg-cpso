## What to Look out for When Buying from Online or Overseas Retailers
The affordability and wide selection of household products available online is very attractive to those in search of a bargain. Many new homeowners arrange bulk purchases or rely on home renovation contractors to source for appliances and furniture, most of which are bought overseas.

However, homeowners need to be aware that safety regulations can vary greatly from country to country. You may not be adequately protected should you decide to buy from an overseas retailer. Always ask if a product meets local safety requirements.

Here are some tips to keep in mind when buying home appliances and electronics online:

General household items such as electrical, electronic and gas appliances under Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations need to carry the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore.<br><br> Photos from online marketplaces may show limited product angles so when in doubt, always ask the seller if the product has been tested for safety and **bears a SAFETY Mark.**

In addition to price, check out past buyersâ€™ feedback, seller ratings and independent product reviews to thoroughly make sure no safety hazards or reliability issues exist.

Always contact the seller to ensure that it comes with plugs and voltages that are suitable for use locally.

In support of the Organisation for Economic Coorperation and Development's [Global Awareness Campaign on online safety](https://www.oecd.org/digital/consumer/put-product-safety-first/), the CPSO encourages consumers to #PutProductSafetyFirst when buying products online.
