<br>When buying electrical appliances online, technical specifications printed
on the packaging may not be shown on the product page. Always contact the
seller to ensure that it comes with plugs and voltages that are suitable
for use locally. Do also check that the electrical appliance is defined
as a Controlled Good, which is required to be affixed with a SAFETY Mark.
