## Type of Mains Plugs Suitable for use in Singapore
Apart from Brunei, Hong Kong, Malaysia or UK, mains plugs that are used in other countries are different from those intended for use in Singapore. It is important to ensure that the correct plug is used with a local wall socket to avoid hazards such as fires and electrocution.

**3 types of mains plugs suitable for use in Singapore**

|![mains plugs 1](/images/consumers/did-you-know/types-of-mains-plugs/mains-plugs-1.jpg)|**(1) The 2.5AMP 2 round-pin mains plug** – This is generally used for electronics appliances such as TV, DVD and audio sets. These appliances do not rely on the ‘Earth’ wire for protection from a short circuit and therefore only 2 pins are needed – one for the ‘Live’ wire and the other for the ‘Neutral’ wire.|
|![mains plugs 2](/images/consumers/did-you-know/types-of-mains-plugs/mains-plugs-2.jpg)|**(2) The 13AMP 3 pin fused mains plug** – This is used for electrical appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and microwave ovens. These appliances have a metal body which must be grounded so that in the event of a short circuit, there is no risk of electrocution to the user.|
|![mains plugs 3](/images/consumers/did-you-know/types-of-mains-plugs/mains-plugs-3.jpg)|**(3) The 15AMP 3 round-pin mains plug** – This is used generally for air-conditioners.|

The 13AMP and 15AMP mains plugs are controlled goods under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations. They must be affixed with the SAFETY Mark which carries a unique certification number traceable to the supplier. When purchasing a mains-powered electric appliance, always ensure that its mains plug carries a SAFETY Mark.

**Caution: Schuko plugs**

Some appliances are fitted with mains plugs meant for the German market. These are **rated at 10/16AMP** and known as **‘Schuko’** plugs (*See image*). This type of mains plug is **not suitable for use in Singapore**. The dimension of the round pins will stress the contacts of the mains socket outlet, subsequently leading to poor contact and overheating.

Furthermore, while ‘Schuko’ plugs may come with earthing strips located on their sides, they are not safe for use in Singapore as the earthing strips cannot make contact with the earth contact of a local mains socket.
