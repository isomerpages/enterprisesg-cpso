## Safety Tips when Charging Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs)
Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) such as electric scooters present a new way to quickly and effortlessly cruise through the streets. These rechargeable lithium-ion battery-powered devices have become a favourite among consumers as part of their last mile commute. Here are some tips which can help you make a more informed choice when using or shopping for one.

**Always use a power adaptor with the SAFETY Mark when charging the device**

Power adaptors belong to the 33 categories of Controlled Goods under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations and are required to carry the SAFETY Mark. The SAFETY Mark can be found either on the product itself or on its packaging.

**Read the charging instructions and other warning labels**

PMD users are advised to follow the manufacturerâ€™s charging and usage instructions. Do not leave devices to charge overnight. Overcharging the battery could cause overheating that may result in a fire. Adults should supervise the charging of all electrical devices by their children.

**Avoid charging the device immediately after usage**

Charging the battery when it is hot may lead to unforeseen damage that compromises the safety of the device. When charging the device, take note of the following:
* Charge in a cool room and away from heat.
* Place it on hard, open and flat surfaces, away from combustible materials.
* Do not cover the device with any fabric during charging as it slows down heat dissipation .

**Avoid charging the device if it was just used in wet conditions**

Allow the device to dry before charging it to prevent short circuits.

**Use compatible power adaptors**

Always use power adaptors that are recommended by the manufacturer. Avoid purchasing after-market power adaptors which may have incompatibility issues.

**Purchase PMDs that are compliant with safety requirements**

Consumers should buy from reputable sources and make sure the device is compliant with safety requirements as stipulated by LTA. Consumers are also discouraged from tampering, modifying or repairing a device on their own.
