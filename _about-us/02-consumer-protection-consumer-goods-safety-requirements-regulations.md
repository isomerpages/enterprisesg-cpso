### Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR)
The [Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/CPTDSRA1975-S113-2011){:target="_blank"} aims to protect consumers from unsafe general consumer goods such as toys, childrenâ€™s products, apparel, sports and recreation products, furniture, mattresses and bedding and DIY tools.

Consumer goods covered by the CGSR must meet any of the following international safety standards:
* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
* International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
* European Committee for Standardisation
* ASTM International

Regional or national standards may also be accepted for consumer goods that do not have applicable international safety standards.

The Consumer Product Safety Office does active post-market surveillance to reduce the impact of unsafe general consumer goods as soon as safety issues are discovered.

If consumer goods do not meet applicable safety standards, the Consumer Product Safety Office can direct suppliers to stop the sale of these goods in the market. We will also direct suppliers to inform users of the potential dangers of such goods. The penalty for non-compliance is a fine and/or imprisonment.

**Exclusion under the Regulations**

The following consumer goods are under other regulations or regulatory agencies in Singapore, and do not come under the CGSR.
