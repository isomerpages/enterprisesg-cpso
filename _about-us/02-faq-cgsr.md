### Frequently Asked Questions on Consumer Protection (Consuemr Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR)

**1. What is the CGSR about?**<br>
The CGSR which came into effect on 1 April 2011,  seeks to enhance the safety of general consumer goods that are currently not under the purview of other regulations or regulatory agencies in Singapore. This generally covers physical/mechanical hazards and electric shock/fire hazards related to consumer products.

**2. What are consuemer goods?**<br>
Consumer goods are items bought by people for their own use, rather than by businesses. They are goods that satisfy personal needs rather than those required for the production of other goods or services.

**3. What products are covered under CGSR?**<br>
The following are examples of general consumer goods covered under CGSR:
* Children’s products, such as walkers and cribs
* Toys, such as balloons, balls and rattles
* Electrical, electronic and gas products that are not regulated under the Consumer Protection
(Safety Requirements) Registration (CPSR)
* Furniture, mattresses and bedding
* DIY products, such as power tools and home improvement products
* Apparel
* Sports and recreation products such as bicycles and treadmills
* Stationery products, such as writing instruments and paper items
* Others such as costume jewellery and watches

**4. What products are not under the purview of the CGSR?**<br>

The CGSR does not cover consumer goods already under the purview of other regulations or regulatory agencies in Singapore. Some examples are:

|Product Type|Regulator|
|---|---|
|Food product and products containing/ in contact with food or beverages / Singapore Food Agency (SFA)|
|Cosmetics, medical devices, pharmaceuticals and Chinese proprietary medicines|Health Sciences Authority (HSA)|
|Motor vehicles and electric bicycles|Land Transport Authority (LTA)|
|Motorcycle helmets and children car's seats|Traffic Police (TP)|
|Hazardous substances|National Environment Agency|
|Pesticides and vector repellents|National Environment Agency|

The following products do not fall under the purview of CGSR and other regulations or regulatory agencies in Singapore:
* Used or second-hand products
* Goods produced solely for export or imported solely for re-export
* Installation works
* Fixtures and fittings
* Products for commercial or industrial use
* The long-term health effects of consumer products

**5. How is CGSR different from the CPSR?**<br>
CGSR covers all general consumer goods that do not come under the purview of other regulations or regulatory agencies in Singapore, and is based on post-market surveillance and action. There is no requirement for pre-market testing, certification or approval from the Consumer Product Safety Office of Enterprise Singapore.

On the other hand, the CPSR covers only 33 categories of household electrical, electronic and gas products, and is based on pre-market control which requires registration with Enterprise Singapore.

**6. Who will be affected by CGSR?**<br>
Suppliers (includes manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers and traders) of general consumer goods that are not under the purview of other regulations or regulatory agencies in Singapore will be affected by CGSR.

**7. What are the respective roles of the authority, suppliers and consumers in the CGSR?**<br>
One of the roles of the Consumer Product Safety Office is to investigate and instruct suppliers of unsafe consumer goods to stop selling them.

* Role of suppliers: To supply safe products. If any consumer goods are found to be unsafe, they should stop selling the goods immediately.
* Role of consumers: To take ownership of their own safety when purchasing and using products, and to take note of unsafe products and recall notices. They should also inform the Consumer Product Safety Office and suppliers if they suspect any product is unsafe.

**8. Are safety/conformity marks (e.g. CE marking) sufficient to ensure that the products are safe?**<br>
Consumers should be aware of various safety/conformity marks and their limitations.

For example, the CE marking is based on suppliers’ declaration of conformity and there is no assurance that consumer goods marked CE have actually been tested to the relevant safety standards.

**9. I suspect that my product is unsafe. What should I do?**<br>
