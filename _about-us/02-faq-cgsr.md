### Frequently Asked Questions on Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR)

**1. What is the Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations 2011 (CGSR) about?**<br>
The [Consumer Protection (Consumer goods Safety Requirements) Regulations](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL-Supp/S184-2018/Published/20180329?DocDate=20180329){:target="_blank"} seeks to enhance the safety of general consumer goods in Singapore. This generally covers physical/mechanical hazards and electric shock/fire hazards related to consumer products.

For products not under the purview of the CGSR please see Q4.

**2. What are *consumer goods*?**<br>
*Consumer goods* are items bought by people for their own use, rather than by businesses.  They are goods that satisfy personal needs rather than those required for the production of other goods or services.

**3.	What products are covered under the CGSR?**<br>
The following are examples of general consumer goods covered under CGSR:

*	Children’s products, such as walkers and cribs
*	Toys, such as balloons, balls and rattle
*	Electrical, electronic and gas products that are not regulated under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR)
*	Furniture, mattresses and bedding
*	DIY products, such as power tools and home improvement products
*	Apparel
*	Sports and recreation products such as exercise equipment
*	Stationery products, such as writing instruments and paper items

**5.	How is CGSR different from the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR)?**<br>
The CPSR covers 33 categories of household electrical, electronic and gas appliances and accessories, and is based on pre-market control which requires registration with the Consumer Product Safety Office.

The CGSR covers general consumer goods which are not under the purview of other regulations or regulatory agencies in Singapore and is based on post-market surveillance and action. There is no requirement for pre-market testing, certification or approval from the Consumer Product Safety Office.

While there is no requirement for general consumer goods to be furnished with a test report before it can be sold, in practice, investigations of a possible non-compliance will include request to access relevant test reports and information to determine the existence of reasonable means in ensuring the consumer good complies to safety requirements.

**6.	When did the CGSR come into effect?**<br>
The CGSR came into effect on 1 April 2011.

**7.	Who will be affected by CGSR?**<br>
Suppliers (includes manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers and traders) of general consumer goods that are not under the purview of other regulations or regulatory agencies in Singapore will be affected by CGSR.

**8.	What is the role of suppliers under the CGSR?**<br>
Suppliers, including manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers and traders, should supply safe products. If suppliers are made aware of any consumer goods sold by them that are unsafe, they should stop selling the unsafe goods immediately and notify the Consumer Product Safety Office.

**9.	Are safety/conformity marks (e.g. CE marking) sufficient to ensure that the products are safe?**<br>
Suppliers should be aware of various safety/conformity marks and their limitations. For example, the CE marking is based on suppliers’ declaration of conformity and there is no assurance that consumer goods marked CE have actually been tested to the relevant EN safety standards.

**10.	What should I do when I suspect that a product is unsafe?**<br>
Suppliers, including manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers and traders, should immediately stop the supply of the product and notify the Consumer Product Safety Office

**11.	What action will the Consumer Product Safety Office take?**<br>
The Consumer Product Safety Office carries out routine market surveillance regularly as part of its enforcement efforts.<br>
* **If there are reasonable grounds to believe a product is unsafe**<br>
The Consumer Product Safety Office will investigate whether the product is indeed unsafe.  

* **If a product is found to be unsafe**<br>
The Consumer Product Safety Office will notify the supplier (includes manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers and traders) and the public of the unsafe product and instruct the supplier to stop the supply of the unsafe product. The Consumer Product Safety Office may also instruct suppliers to inform users of the potential dangers of the product.

**12.	What are the offences under the CGSR?**<br>

  a.	continues selling the goods on or after the day following the issue of a public notice declaring any consumer goods to be unsafe; or<br>
