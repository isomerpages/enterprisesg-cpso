### Frequently Asked Questions on Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR)

**1. What is the CPSR about?**<br>
The [Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/CPTDSRA1975-RG1?DocDate=20181010){:target="_blank"}( requires 33 categories<sup>1</sup> of household electrical, electronic and gas appliances & accessories, also known as Controlled Goods, to be tested to specified safety standards, registered with the authority, and affixed with the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore.

<sup>1</sup>On 15 January 2018, amendments to the CPSR and the Enterprise Singapore Board (Conformity Assessment) Regulations (“ESGBR”) brought about changes to the conformity assessment framework and product categories of Controlled Goods. The product categories have since been reduced and refined to 33 product categories.

**3. How do I register the Controlled Goods?**<br>
*For low risk Controlled Goods:*<br>
The RS can submit a Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) to the Consumer Product Safety Office. In doing so the RS is making a self-declaration that the low risk CGs conform to the requirements of CPSR.

*For medium and high risk Controlled Goods:*<br>
The RS submits test reports and other relevant documentation to a Conformity Assessment Body (Certification) for review. If the CGs meets safety requirements, the CAB (Certification) issues a Certificate of Conformity (CoC) and submits the CoC to the Consumer Product Safety Office.

If the Consumer Product Safety Office deems the application is in order, a Letter of Approval (LOA) will be issued to the RS.
