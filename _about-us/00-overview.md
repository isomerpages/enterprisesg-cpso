# About the Consumer Product Safety Office
The Consumer Product Safety Office is a department of Enterprise Singapore that oversees the administration of the [Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/CPTDSRA1975-RG1?DocDate=20181010&ValidDate=20181011){:target="_blank"} and [Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations 2011 (CGSR)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/CPTDSRA1975-S113-2011){:target="_blank"} to ensure that the consumer products suppliers put on the market are safe.

Our mission is to safeguard consumers from unsafe consumer products and have consumers trust in the safety of consumer products supplied in Singapore.

### What we do?
We seek to achieve this through our Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Registration Scheme (CPS Scheme) requiring household appliances designated as Controlled Goods under [CPSR](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/CPTDSRA1975-RG1?DocDate=20181010&ValidDate=20181011){:target="_blank"}
