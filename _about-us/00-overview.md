## About the Consumer Product Safety Office
The Consumer Product Safety Office (CPSO) implements the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR) and Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR) to ensure products supplied in Singapore are safe for use by requiring them to comply with applicable safety standards. Controlled goods under the CPSR are further required to be registered with the CPSO and affixed with the Safety Mark before they can be sold. The CPSO is overseen by Enterprise Singapore. 

### What we do
To safeguard the interest of our consumers, the Consumer Product Safety Office perform the following functions:
* Register the suppliers of controlled goods
* Register controlled goods
* Educate suppliers on the requirements of the CPSR and CGSR
* Appoint third-party Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) to carry out product testing and ensure compliance with specified safety standards
* Conduct market surveillance and investigate accidents, incidents or feedback relating to the safety of consumer products regulated under the CPSR and CGSR

### Choosing the right products and using products safely
Consumers have a role to play by choosing products that comply with safety requirements and using products safely. We equip consumers with relevant information on how they can use products responsibly to prevent injuries to themselves and their families.

### Supplying safe consumer products and controlled goods
Manufacturers, importers (including parallel importers), retailers and traders who are involved in advertising and/or supplying Controlled Goods under the CPSR, must ensure that their products have been tested and certified compliant to applicable safety standards, then registered with the Consumer Product Safety Office, and affxied with the Safety Mark before they can be supplied in Singapore.

Suppliers of general consumer goods under the purview of the CGSR should ensure their products conform with relevant internationally accepted product safety standards.
