### What can Suppliers do to ensure they supply safe consumer products?
Manufacturers, importers (including parallel importers), retailers and traders who are involved in advertising and/or supplying Controlled Goods under the CPSR, must ensure that their products have been tested and certified compliant to applicable safety standards, then registered with the Consumer Product Safety Office, and affxied with the Safety Mark before they can be supplied in Singapore.

Suppliers of general consumer goods under the purview of the CGSR should ensure their products conform with relevant internationally accepted product safety standards.
