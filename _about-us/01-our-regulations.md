## Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR)
The Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR) requires 33 categories of household products, also known as Controlled Goods, to be registered with the authority. These products need to be tested to specified safety standards and affixed with the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore. 

Registration of Controlled Goods under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations is based on Certificates of Conformity (CoC) issued by designated third party Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs), or Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) declared by Registered Suppliers.

Once the model has been registered, the Controlled Goods can then be advertised for supply and/or supplied in Singapore. This requirement also applies to Controlled Goods sold through online platforms.

Any person found guilty of selling unregistered Controlled Goods, is liable upon conviction, to a fine not exceeding S$10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both. 

## Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR)
The Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR) aims to protect consumers from unsafe general consumer goods such as toys, children’s products, apparel, sports and recreation products, furniture, mattresses and bedding and DIY tools.

Consumer goods covered by the CGSR must meet any of the following international safety standards:
* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
* International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
* European Committee for Standardisation
* ASTM International

Regional or national standards may also be accepted for consumer goods that do not have the applicable international safety standards.

The Consumer Product Safety Office does active post-market surveillance to reduce the impact of unsafe general consumer goods as soon as safety issues are discovered.

If consumer goods do not meet applicable safety standards, suppliers will be required to stop the sale of these goods in the market. We will also direct suppliers to inform users of the potential dangers of such goods. The penalty for non-compliance is a fine and/or imprisonment.
