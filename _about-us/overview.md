## About the Consumer Product Safety Office
The Consumer Product Safety Office (CPSO) safeguards consumer safety by ensuring consumer products supplied in Singapore are safe for use and comply with applicable safety standards.

To ensure consumer safety, the CPSO implements the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations (CPSR) and Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR). Products regulated under the CPSR must be registered with the CPSO and affixed with SAFETY Mark before they can be sold. The CPSO conducts market surveillance to verify products' compliance with safety requirements and investigates feedback on consumer product safety. We also keep consumers informed about the latest product safety information.

The CPSO is an office overseen by the Competition & Consumer Commission of Singapore. 

## What we do

## Supplying safe consumer products and controlled goods
Manufacturers, importers (including parallel importers), retailers and traders who are involved in advertising and/or supplying Controlled Goods under the CPSR, must ensure that their products have been tested and certified compliant to applicable safety standards, then registered with the Consumer Product Safety Office, and affxied with the Safety Mark before they can be supplied in Singapore.
