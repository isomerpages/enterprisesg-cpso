<h3><strong><u>Purview of the Consumer Product Safety Office (CPSO)</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What products are under the CPSO’s purview?</strong>
</p>
<p>The CPSO regulates 33 categories of household electrical, electronic and
gas appliances and accessories as Controlled Goods (CGs). These appliances
must be tested to specified safety standards, registered with the CPSO,
and affixed with the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore.
Click <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/suppliers/cpsr/list-of-controlled-goods/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for
the full list of CGs.</p>
<p>The CPSO also regulates general consumer goods which are not under the
purview of other Singaporean regulatory agencies, such as: toys, apparel,
furniture, sports and recreation products, stationery, costume jewellery,
and children's products. Such goods are required to conform to applicable
safety standards, but do not require pre-market approval from the CPSO
before they can be supplied. The CPSO oversees these goods through post-market
surveillance and action.
<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What products are not under the CPSO’s purview?</strong>
</p>
<p>The CPSO does not regulate consumer goods already under the purview of
other Singaporean regulatory agencies. These include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;Food products and products containing/in contact with food or beverages:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Food Agency (SFA)</a>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;Cosmetics, medical devices, pharmaceuticals and Chinese proprietary
medicines:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hsa.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Health Sciences Authority (HSA)</a>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;Motor vehicles, personal mobility devices and electric bicycles:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Land Transport Authority (LTA)</a>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;Motorcycle helmets and children’s car seats:&nbsp;<a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL-Supp/S688-2011/Published/20111227170000?DocDate=20111227170000&amp;WholeDoc=1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Traffic Police (TP</a>)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;Hazardous substances, pesticides and vector repellents, irradiating
apparatus:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/pollution-control/chemical-safety/hazardous-substances" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Environment Agency (NEA)</a>
</p>
<p>The following are also not under the purview of the CPSO:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Used or second-hand general consumer goods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goods produced solely for export or imported solely for re-export</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installation works (e.g. involving fixed wiring, fixtures, and fittings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customised furnishings and furniture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Products supplied solely for commercial or industrial use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long-term health effects arising from consumer products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hazards caused by the misuse or unintended use of products</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What actions can the CPSO take? <br></strong>The
CPSO regularly carries out market surveillance as part of its enforcement
efforts. If there are reasonable grounds to believe a product does not
conform to its applicable safety standards, the CPSO will look into the
matter and may notify the supplier and the public, and instruct the supplier
to stop the supply of the unsafe product. The CPSO may also instruct suppliers
to inform users of the product’s potential dangers.</p>
<p>With regards to the 33 categories of CGs, the CPSO identifies and acts
against suppliers and traders selling CGs that contravene our regulatory
requirements. For e-commerce sales, we also work with online platforms
to take down listings of CGs that are unregistered or that have a false
SAFETY Mark. Repeat offenders may be subject to punitive measures such
as fines. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the CPSO help me seek redress from suppliers?</strong>
</p>
<p>The CPSO is unable to assist with resolution matters between suppliers
and consumers (e.g. refunds, after-sales services, etc.). For resolution
matters, consumers may wish to contact the <a href="https://www.case.org.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE)</a>.</p>
<h3><strong><u>Product Safety Tips</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I check if my appliance has a valid SAFETY Mark?</strong>
</p>
<p>Visit <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/safety-mark</a>.
Key in the 8-digit registration number on the SAFETY Mark, or the product
model number. Then, check that the product information in the search results
tallies with your product. Click <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/consumers/choose-safer-products/look-for-the-safety-mark/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to
learn more about the SAFETY Mark. You may submit an enquiry to the CPSO
via the “Report” button on the <a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/Homepage" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPSA+ homepage</a> if the SAFETY
Mark number on your appliance does not tally with the information in the
database.</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">online database</a>, the Safety Mark on my appliance appears to be that for a 3-pin plug. What does that mean?</strong>
</p>
<p>13-amp rectangular type, and 15-amp round type 3-Pin plugs are classified
as Controlled Goods under the CPSR and will require a separate Safety Mark.
If your appliance itself is a Controlled Good, it would require its own
Safety Mark. If not, then a SAFETY Mark is not needed. You may submit an
enquiry to the CPSO via the “Report” button on the <a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/Homepage" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPSA+ homepage</a> if your appliance
is a Controlled Good and you cannot locate its relevant SAFETY Mark.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if the SAFETY Mark on my appliance is listed as “Expired” in the database?</strong>
</p>
<p>The product was previously tested and certified to meet the relevant safety
standards as part of the SAFETY Mark registration process. The product
is compliant with our regulations if it was purchased from a retailer before
the expiry date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I purchase Controlled Goods (CGs) without a SAFETY Mark?</strong>
</p>
<p>The SAFETY Mark indicates that products have undergone testing and certification
to minimize risk of potential dangers such as fire, electric shock and
explosion. There is no assurance that CGs without the SAFETY Mark have
gone through the same testing and certification process. They may therefore
expose users to potential safety risks. As such, the CPSO strongly discourages
consumers from purchasing CGs without the SAFETY Mark. Consumers who choose
to purchase unregistered CGs will be doing so at their own risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I choose safer consumer products and use them safely?</strong>
</p>
<p>Before purchase, the CPSO recommends that you research the product and
brand, for example by reading past customer reviews to check for safety
or reliability issues. When possible, buy from reputable sellers and well-known
brands with good safety records. Check that electrical products use plugs
and voltages suitable for local use, such as a 3-pin Singapore plug with
a valid SAFETY Mark. Click <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/types-of-mains-plugs-suitable-for-use-in-singapore/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to
learn about the types of plugs that are suitable for use in Singapore.</p>
<p>After purchase, check the item for defects, read the user manual, and
use the item according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>Maintain the product to ensure it remains safe over time by cleaning it
as directed and regularly checking for signs of wear and tear. You can
stay informed about potential issues by checking for <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/consumers/safety-alerts-and-recalls/children-apparel/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">product recalls</a> and,
where possible, by registering your purchase with the manufacturer to receive
important updates directly.</p>
