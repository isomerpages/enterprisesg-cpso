<h3><strong><u>Registration of Controlled Goods (CGs)</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I register Controlled Goods (CGs)?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>For <em>low risk CGs:</em></strong> The Registered Supplier (RS)
can submit a Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) to the CPSO via
the CPSA+ system. In doing so, the RS is making a self-declaration that
the low risk CGs conform to the requirements of the Consumer Protection
(Safety Requirements) Regulations.</p>
<p><strong>For <em>medium and high risk CGs</em></strong><em>:</em> The RS
should first obtain the relevant test reports for their products. The following
types of test reports are accepted for purposes of CG registration:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reports with IECEE CB certificates, which
are affixed with such logos:</p>

</div>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reports issued by testing laboratories
accredited by the Singapore Accreditation Council or its Mutual Recognition
Agreement partners. An example of such an agreement is the ILAC-MRA, where
test reports will be affixed with this logo:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 10%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ILAC_MRA_logo.png">
</div>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reports issued by designated Conformity
Assessment Bodies (Testing). Our list of Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs)
can be found on page 3 of this document: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://file.go.gov.sg/list-of-cps-cab.pdf</a>
</p>
<p>The RS then submits the test reports and other relevant documentation
to a CAB (Certification) for review. If the CGs meet safety requirements,
the CAB (Certification) issues a Certificate of Conformity (CoC) and submits
the CoC to the CPSO. If the CPSO deems the application to be in order,
a Letter of Approval will be issued to the RS. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registration is completed when the registration fee for the SDoC and the
CoC is paid. The RS will be issued a SAFETY Mark number, which must be
displayed on all units of the CG or its packaging. The SAFETY Mark number
is the same for every single model of the product.</p>
<p>Click <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/suppliers/cpsr/register-your-controlled-goods/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to
find out more on how to register CGs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the CPSO conduct testing on products for the purpose of registering CGs?</strong>
</p>
<p>The CPSO is not a test laboratory and does not perform any testing. For
the testing and certification of CGs, please refer to the list of Conformity
Assessment Bodies <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/images/cpsr-resources/list-of-cab-cps-scheme-ver-22-04-21.xlsx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much does it cost to test and certify my CGs?</strong>
</p>
<p>The CPSO does not directly regulate prices charged by Conformity Assessment
Bodies for testing and certification. Therefore, we are unable to advise
on the cost of these services. However, we recommend that you approach
multiple CABs for price comparison. The CABs can also better guide you
through the registration process (e.g. the type of test reports needed)
after reviewing your product’s technical specifications.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long does it take to test or to certify CGs?</strong>
</p>
<p>This is dependent on your product and your arrangement with the Conformity
Assessment Bodies. Registered Suppliers should check with the CABs to gauge
the amount of lead time needed and allocate ample time for the testing,
certification and registration process. Depending on the complexity and
logistics arrangements with the CABs, the entire process may take several
months to complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the validity period of the CG registration?</strong>
</p>
<p>The registration of CGs is valid for three years and may be renewed prior
to expiry. Registered Suppliers should initiate the renewal process at
least 6 months prior to the expiration date to cater for any potential
unforeseen delays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does the registration of CGs expire?</strong>
</p>
<p>Controlled Goods (CGs) may evolve over time due to reasons such as changes
in components or in manufacturing processes, which may make the product
different from their initial design. Concurrently, regulatory requirements
are periodically updated to align with industry developments and ensure
continued protection for consumers. Examples of updates may include revisions
to safety standards required for the SAFETY Mark.</p>
<p>Hence, the expiry and renewal process serve to ensure ongoing compliance
of CGs with current regulatory requirements, and that they adhere to any
updated regulations introduced since their last certification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a parallel importer, reseller, or distributor. Do I need to register for a SAFETY Mark?</strong>
</p>
<p>At least one party in the supply chain must register for the SAFETY Mark
and affix it on the product before it is supplied to consumers. You cannot
use the SAFETY Mark belonging to another registering company without their
permission unless they are part of your supply chain.</p>
<p>Generally, if you have purchased units of the CG already affixed with
the SAFETY Mark, you may continue using the SAFETY Mark issued to the original
registering company. Depending on business arrangements, you may need to
establish an agreement with the company that initially registered the product,
before supplying it in Singapore.</p>
<p>However, if you are unable to purchase units already affixed with the
SAFETY Mark, you may need to register the product yourself, which involves
sending the product for testing and certification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do CGs supplied between businesses require a SAFETY Mark?</strong>
</p>
<p>Suppliers who choose to supply only to the commercial market need not
register their goods with the CPSO. However, they must ensure that the
end users of such goods are not consumers. This could be done by vetting
potential buyers or limiting sales channels to ensure the CGs are only
for use or installed in non-households. A CG that is eventually used by
consumers downstream for <em>home use</em> will require the SAFETY Mark.</p>
<p>For example, if a supplier sells washing machines to a condominium developer
to be placed inside the condominium units, the washing machines will require
a SAFETY Mark. A party in the supply chain (e.g. the supplier or the condominium
developer) must then register the washing machine before it reaches consumers.</p>
<h3><strong><u>Displaying the SAFETY Mark</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How should the SAFETY Mark be displayed on Controlled Goods (CGs)?</strong>
</p>
<p>Please refer to the guidelines on the usage of the SAFETY Mark <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/images/cpsr-resources/guidelines-on-the-usage-of-the-safety-mark.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.
In general, the SAFETY Mark should be easily discernible on the CGs. The
marking should not be removed when rubbed lightly with a piece of cloth
soaked with petroleum, spirit, or water.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>10.&nbsp; How should the SAFETY Mark be displayed on AC adaptors?</strong>
</p>
<p>For AC adaptors to be used with <em>other</em> products, registration is
granted for the adaptors only and does not cover the other products. Therefore,
only the adaptors should be affixed with the SAFETY Mark.</p>
<p>However, if the SAFETY Mark is affixed on packaging containing both the
AC adaptor and other products, then the statement “This SAFETY Mark applies
to the AC Adaptor only” must be printed near the SAFETY Mark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>11.&nbsp; How should the SAFETY Mark be displayed on mains plugs, portable socket-outlets, and portable cable reels?</strong>
</p>
<p>For <strong>3-pin mains plugs (13 and 15 amperes)</strong>:</p>
<p>The SAFETY Mark must carry the statement “For mains plug” below the certification
number.</p>
<p>For <strong>3-pin portable socket-outlets</strong>:</p>
<p>The SAFETY Mark must carry the statement “For 3-pin portable socket-outlet”
below the certification number.</p>
<p>For <strong>portable cable reels</strong>:</p>
<p>The SAFETY Mark must carry the statement “For portable cable reel” below
the certification number.</p>
