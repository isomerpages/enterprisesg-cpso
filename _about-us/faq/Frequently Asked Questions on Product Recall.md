<li>
<p><strong>If I suspect a product I manufactured, imported, distributed, offered to sell, or sold might be a hazard, how much time do I have to report this to the CPSO?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppliers should notify the Authority within 2 days if the incident is
reportable under <u>Mandatory Reporting</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Does filing a report with the CPSO mean that the I must recall my product?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No, suppliers should assess the risk of harm and determine the need for
a product recall. Suppliers should also inform the Authority of the intended
product recall within 7 days after it is initiated, as required under Mandatory
Reporting. Suppliers are to submit a <u>Recall Action Plan (RAP)</u> to CPSO
prior to enacting a product recall.</p>

<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>What if I do not sell directly to consumers, but my supply chain customers do, am I responsible for managing the recall?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, each entity in the supply chain is responsible for assessing and
(if necessary) rectifying potential safety hazards presented by the consumer
products that they supply.</p>
<p></p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>After the recall is closed, what do I do if I continue to receive incident reports from industry or consumers that were not aware of the product recall?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppliers are to ensure that consumers should be able to return the affected
product at all times. The supplier should therefore continue to provide
capability to receive products that are subject to recall, even if the
active recall operation has concluded. Suppliers should also notify the
Authority of the incident reports.</p>
