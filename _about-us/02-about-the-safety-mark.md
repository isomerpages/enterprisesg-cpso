## About the SAFETY Mark

![safety mark](/images/about-us/safety-mark.jpg)

The SAFETY Mark helps consumers and suppliers identify registered Controlled Goods. These goods must carry the SAFETY Mark on the product. The mark consists of a “safety logo” and the words “SAFETY MARK” in a rectangle on the right. These goods can also be traced with a unique 8-digit registration number to the registrant and the registered models. The register can be found here.



Register the Controlled Goods here. You can also contact us at consumerprotection@enterprisesg.gov.sg or (65) 1800 773 3163 for further enquiries.
