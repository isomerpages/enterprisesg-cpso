## About the SAFETY Mark

![safety mark](/images/about-us/safety-mark.jpg)

The SAFETY Mark helps consumers and suppliers identify registered [Controlled Goods](/about-us/about-controlled-goods). These goods must carry the SAFETY Mark on the product. The mark consists of a “safety logo” and the words “SAFETY MARK” in a rectangle on the right. These goods can also be traced with a unique 8-digit registration number to the registrant and the registered models. 

The validity of the SAFETY Mark may be verified in 3 easy steps:

|           |                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
