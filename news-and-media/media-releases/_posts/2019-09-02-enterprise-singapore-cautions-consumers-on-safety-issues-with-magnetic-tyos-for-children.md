## Enterprise Singapore cautions consumers on safety issues with magnetic toys for children

MR No.: 047/19<br>
Singapore, Monday, 2 September 2019

1\. Enterprise Singapore consumers on safety issues for two types of magnetic toys<sup>1</sup> – (i) magnetic building block sets and (ii) magnetic balls (commonly known as “Buckyballs”). As the regulatory agency for product safety of general consumer goods, we conducted a surveillance comprising ten samples of the magnetic toys, which concluded last month. All were found to be unsafe, where the mechanical properties did not comply with the safety requirements by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), [ISO 8124-1](https://www.iso.org/standard/74477.html){:target="_blank"}. (Refer to listing of the ten samples in **Annex 1**)

2\. A key concern of these toys is that it may contain high-powered magnets, and can cause harm if several are ingested by children. The tiny magnets can attract each other through the intestines, and potentially result in injuries such as perforation, scarring or infection. In serious incidents - where a 4-year-old child in [the United States](https://www.today.com/health/toy-magnets-mom-warns-after-boy-needs-emergency-surgery-t146003){:target="_blank"} swallowed 13 magnets after a magnetic building block toy broke open, and a 14-month-old boy in [China](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2147078/chinese-toddler-has-surgery-remove-21-magnetic-beads-his-stomach?utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook#link_time=1526893345){:target="_blank"} swallowed 21 magnetic balls<sup>2</sup> - surgeries were required.

3\.Other safety issues to look out for in the magnetic toys include:
* Small parts, which can be ingested by young children, especially those under the age of 6, if played without supervision;
* Age specification on the product or packaging. The Buckyballs tested were marketed as toys for children, when they are intended for use by adults as a desk toy for relieving stress;
* Suffocation to young children posed by plastic bags<sup>3</sup> as some of the toy components are stored in them;
* Other safety matters such as piercing hazard from protruding parts, or finger entrapment due to improper toy design.


<sup>1</sup>Magnetic toys are commonly sold online and marketed as educational toys, consisting different shapes and sizes that attract each other when put together, allowing for constructive play. The toys are said to help children exercise their creativity, develop motor skills and coordination.

<sup>2</sup>In the United States last year, a 4-year-old child swallowed 13 magnets after a magnetic building block toy broke open. After he started vomiting, he was rushed to a hospital where doctors removed part of his colon, intestine and appendix to extract the magnets. In China last year, a 14-month-old boy swallowed 21 magnetic balls. He had to undergo emergency surgery to remove the balls from his stomach, which had formed a ring while inside his stomach.

<sup>3</sup>Small and thin plastic bags could get moulded to a child’s face and cause suffocation. The standard specifies requirements for such plastic bags, where there must be holes of certain sizes throughout the plastic bag to allow airflow through the plastic bags.
