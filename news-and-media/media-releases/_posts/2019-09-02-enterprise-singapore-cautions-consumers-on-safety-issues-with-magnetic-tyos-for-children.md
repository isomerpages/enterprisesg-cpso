## Enterprise Singapore cautions consumers on safety issues with magnetic toys for children

MR No.: 047/19<br>
Singapore, Monday, 2 September 2019

1. Enterprise Singapore consumers on safety issues for two types of magnetic toys<sup>1</sup> – (i) magnetic building block sets and (ii) magnetic balls (commonly known as “Buckyballs”). As the regulatory agency for product safety of general consumer goods, we conducted a surveillance comprising ten samples of the magnetic toys, which concluded last month. All were found to be unsafe, where the mechanical properties did not comply with the safety requirements by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), [ISO 8124-1](https://www.iso.org/standard/74477.html){:target="_blank"}. (Refer to listing of the ten samples in **Annex 1**)
