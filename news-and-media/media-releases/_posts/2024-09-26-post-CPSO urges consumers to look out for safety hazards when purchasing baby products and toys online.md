<p>MR No.: 034/24</p>
<p>Singapore, Thursday, 26 September 2024</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Consumer Product Safety Office (CPSO) has uncovered safety issues
in three categories of products for toddlers and children, namely <strong>(i) baby bouncers; (ii) baby walkers; and (iii) toys<sup>1</sup></strong> sold
on two major e-commerce platforms Shopee and Lazada. This was detected
following market surveillance efforts in the first half of 2024, where
23 product samples<sup>2</sup> purchased from the e-commerce platforms were
inspected. Of which, 15 samples were found to be unsafe as they did not
meet applicable product safety standards under the Consumer Protection
(Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations (CGSR).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common hazards identified in these non-compliant products, include:</p>
<p>• Baby bouncers with small, detachable parts that can cause choking and/or
stability issue that can lead to toppling.</p>
<p>• Baby walkers with non-compliant openings and crevices that can lead
to entrapment and stability issue that can lead to toppling.</p>
<p>• Toys with small and easily removable parts or magnetic parts, which
present risk of choking and strangulation</p>
<p>(Refer to <strong>Annex A</strong> for list of unsafe products and safety
hazards detected).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety incidents involving children’s products</strong>
</p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In Singapore, safety incidents involving the use of such children’s products
have continued to occur. On average, the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital
(KKH) sees over 10 cases of child injuries arising from the use of baby
walkers and bouncers each year. These injuries include fractures and head
injuries due to falls, lacerations by sharp points, and second-degree burns
when children in walkers are unsupervised and get access to areas with
hot liquids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incidents involving toys with small or magnetic parts also remain frequent,
with the hospital registering an average of 46 such cases per year over
the past two years. In severe cases, small strong magnets that have been
ingested by children accidentally can trap the intestines between them,
leading to blockages or puncture the intestinal walls. Small parts of toys
that may become detached and swallowed can also cause choking, and result
in death if the windpipe of the child is completely blocked.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ensuring product safety for children</strong>
</p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Following the market surveillance, CPSO has engaged the relevant retailers,
and they have since removed all the non-compliant products for sale. Consumers
who have purchased the affected products are advised to stop using them;
those who may have purchased similar products should also note the potential
hazards. CPSO will continue to engage e-commerce platforms regularly and
work with them in advising their sellers on the importance of complying
with the CGSR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers also play an important part in ensuring the goods that they
buy online are safe, since they may not be able to physically inspect the
products at the point of sale. They can refer to the following safety tips
when purchasing children’s products online (Refer to <strong>Annex B</strong> for
more product-specific safety tips):</p>
<p>a. Buy from official stores or reputable brands and sellers;</p>
<p>b. Check online listings and product labels for age and safety instructions.
Caregivers should use this information to determine product suitability
for their child. If in doubt, do not purchase, allow use or play.</p>
<p>c. Examine both positive and negative product reviews from other buyers
to gauge the product’s quality and potential safety concerns;</p>
<p>d. Contact the seller for more information if the product listing or label
does not clearly explain its features, functionality, and safety instructions;</p>
<p>e. Inspect the product once received for any broken or unsafe parts before
use;</p>
<p>f. Supervise your child when they are using or playing with the product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the CGSR, suppliers and manufacturers of general consumer goods
have to meet applicable international safety standards by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC), European Committee for Standardisation (EN), and ASTM
International. Any person who fails to comply with the CPSO’s directions
to stop the sale of unsafe products, is liable upon conviction, up to a
fine not exceeding S$10,000 or to an imprisonment for a term not exceeding
2 years or to both.</p>
