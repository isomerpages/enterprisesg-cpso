<p>MR No.: 014/25</p>
<p>Singapore, Friday, 28 March 2025
<br>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2024, the Consumer
Product Safety Office (CPSO) found more than 6,900 listings of household
appliances, classified as Controlled Goods, sold online that were not affixed
with a valid SAFETY Mark or registered with the CPSO in accordance with
regulatory requirements under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements)
Regulations (CPSR)<sup>1</sup>. This was uncovered through the CPSO's market
surveillance efforts and investigations into consumer feedback on non-compliant
products sold on major e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Carousell, Lazada,
Qoo10, Shopee, and Tik Tok, between January and December 2024.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of non-compliant
household appliances detected in 2024 is more than double that of previous
years, where an average of around 3,000 non-compliant appliances were uncovered
annually between 2021 and 2023. The increased detection in 2024 was driven
by greater public awareness of product safety issues, resulting in a rise
in consumer feedback that enabled CPSO to conduct more targeted investigations
and uncover a higher number of non-compliant appliances.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kitchen countertop
appliances were the most common non-compliant household appliances, accounting
for about 60% of the total number of non-compliant listings found. These
include appliances for heating liquids and food preparation (e.g. kettles,
coffee machines, slow cookers) as well as those for food processing (e.g.
mixers, blenders). Other prominent categories of non-compliant products
include portable socket outlets and hair care appliances.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPSO has since
worked with the e-commerce platforms to remove all the non-compliant listings.
We will also continue to engage these platforms regularly to strengthen
seller compliance through various deterrence measures that various platforms
have implemented, such as exclusion from platform-wide marketing campaigns,
reduced listing visibility in search results, as well as account suspension
or termination for errant sellers.</p>
<p><strong>Safety considerations when purchasing appliances online&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Online shopping has increasingly become a norm
for consumers, given the convenience and accessibility to diverse products
via e-commerce platforms. It is thus important for consumers to remain
vigilant and conduct thorough checks when purchasing products like household
appliances online. Consumers should perform checks in the following key
areas:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SAFETY Mark</strong>: Check the photos
and description of the listing for presence of the SAFETY Mark, which indicates
that the product has undergone safety-related testing and certification.
Consumers can also verify the validity of the SAFETY Mark on the CPSO’s
<a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/Homepage/RegisterOfRegisteredControlledGoods" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Register of Registered Controlled Goods</a>.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Seller and Product Reliability</strong>:
Check past reviews by other buyers to ensure no safety hazards or reliability
issues have been reported. Choose a seller that provides full product warranty
by the manufacturer, customer service support, and a return or exchange
policy.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Safety Alerts and Recalls:</strong> Check
the CPSO's <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/consumers/safety-alerts-and-recalls/electrical/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Product Safety Alerts and Recalls</a> webpage
to ensure the product has not been recalled by its manufacturer, or banned
by regulatory authorities due to safety issues.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Suitability for Local Use</strong>:
Check the listing description or contact the seller for information around
the product’s technical specifications. Consumers should confirm that the
appliance comes with a <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/types-of-mains-plugs-suitable-for-use-in-singapore/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mains plug type</a> and
rated voltage suitable for use in Singapore<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Beatrice Wong, Director of CPSO</strong> said,
“It is important for consumers to purchase and use only household and electrical
appliances that comply with the relevant regulatory requirements, otherwise
they can face risks such as electric shocks, burns, and fire hazards. With
the rise in number of non-compliant appliances detected over the past few
years, it is increasingly important for consumers to exercise due diligence
when purchasing household appliances. We will continue to educate consumers
and sellers on our safety regulations through our outreach efforts, and
work with all major e-commerce platforms to ensure compliance.”</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPSO encourages consumers who encounter
the sale of any non-compliant products to report them to us at 6898 1800
or <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">consumerproductsafety@enterprisesg.gov.sg</a>.
The CPSO takes a serious view of non-compliance and will not hesitate to
take punitive actions such as issuing warnings, fines or even court prosecution
against errant sellers. Under the CPSR, any person found guilty of selling
unregistered Controlled Goods is liable upon conviction, to a fine not
exceeding S$10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years,
or both.</p>
