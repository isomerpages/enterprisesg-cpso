MR No.: 109/21<br>
Singapore, Friday, 17 December 2021

1\. This year, the Consumer Product Safety Office (CPSO) <sup>1</sup> found more than 2,900 household appliances – classified as Controlled Goods<sup>2</sup> – sold on major e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Carousell, Ezbuy, Lazada, Qoo10 and Shopee in Singapore that were not registered with the CPSO or did not bear a valid SAFETY Mark in accordance with regulatory requirements. These were a result of the CPSO’s market surveillance efforts and investigations of consumer complaints received between January to November 2021.

2\. The top five categories of unregistered household appliances sold online, which did not meet regulatory requirements, were AC adaptors, portable socket outlets, cooking appliances (such as toasters, grills and hotplates), hair care appliances (such as hair dryers), and liquid heating appliances (such as kettles and hot water dispensers). 

3\. Working with the CPSO, the e-commerce platforms have since delisted the unregistered household appliances <sup>3</sup>. The CPSO has also issued fines or warnings to sellers of these products. Sellers found guilty of selling unregistered controlled goods are liable upon conviction, to a fine not exceeding S$10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both.

**Safety considerations when buying products online**<br>

4\. With the rise in e-commerce and consumer shift to online shopping, product safety for online purchases has become an increasingly important issue to be addressed. Consumers can play their part by using products that meet safety requirements, and adopt the following good practices when purchasing household appliances online.<br>

a. **Check product listing**: Listings on online marketplaces may show limited product angles and description. When in doubt, consumers should contact the sellers for more details on the product features, functionality and safety requirements (including whether it bears a SAFETY Mark).

b.**Check product safety**: Consumer can check the validity of the SAFETY Mark for a product by visiting the <a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/Homepage/RegisterOfRegisteredControlledGoodsConsumer">Product Safety and Accuracy Plus (CPSA+) System</a> {:target="_blank"} to view the Register of Registered Controlled Goods. They can also check if a safety alert has been issued for a product by visiting CPSO’s <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/consumers/product-safety-alerts-and-recalls/children-apparel?utm_source=collateral&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=MR-Dec2021&utm_content=media-release">Product Safety Alerts and Recalls</a> {:target="_blank"}  page and to determine whether products have previously been recalled by the manufacturer or had its sale ceased by regulatory bodies over safety issues.

c. **Check seller reliability**: Consumers can check past buyers’ feedback, seller ratings and independent product reviews to ensure no safety hazards or reliability issues have been reported for the product that they intend to purchase. They should also choose a seller that provides full product warranty by the manufacturer, customer service support and a return or exchange policy. 

d. **Check product compatibility for local use**: For online purchases of electrical appliances, technical specifications printed on the packaging may not be shown on the product page. Consumer should always contact the seller to verify the details and ensure that it comes with <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/types-of-mains-plugs-suitable-for-use-in-singapore"> plugs</a> {:target="_blank"}  and voltages<sup>4</sup>  that are suitable for use locally.
