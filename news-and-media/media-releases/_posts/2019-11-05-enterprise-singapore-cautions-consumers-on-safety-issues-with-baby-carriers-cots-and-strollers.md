### Enterprise Singapore cautions consumers on safety issues with baby carriers, cots, and strollers

Singapore, Tuesday, 5 November 2019

Enterprise Singapore, the regulatory agency for product safety of general consumer goods, cautions consumers on safety issues for three types of children’s products – i) baby carriers, ii) cots, and iii) strollers. Surveillance was conducted on 16 samples1 of these three products that concluded last month. Of the samples tested, 11 were found to be unsafe as they did not comply with the safety requirements by the American Society for Testing and Materials International (ASTM), the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), or the European Committee for Standardisation (EN)2 (Refer to list of unsafe products in Annex 1).
