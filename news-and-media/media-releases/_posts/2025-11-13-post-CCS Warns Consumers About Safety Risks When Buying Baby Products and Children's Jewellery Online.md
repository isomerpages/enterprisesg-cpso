<h4><strong>MEDIA RELEASE</strong><br><strong>13 November 2025</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>CCS Warns Consumers About Safety Risks When Buying Baby Products and Children's Jewellery Online</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of ongoing
efforts to safeguard consumers, the Consumer Product Safety Office (“<strong>CPSO</strong>”)
of the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (“<strong>CCS</strong>”)
has conducted a market surveillance and uncovered safety issues in three
categories of products for children, namely (i) baby cots; (ii) strollers;
and (iii) children’s jewellery (including accessories).</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout 2025, the
CPSO purchased and tested 22 products offered mainly by suppliers on either
Shopee or Lazada. Of the 22 higher risk products sampled, 17 were found
to be unsafe as they did not meet applicable product safety standards under
the Consumer Protection (Consumer Goods Safety Requirements) Regulations
2011 ("<strong>CGSR</strong>"). The remaining five products comprising
toys for babies and young children, were found to conform to international
standards for physical and chemical safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common hazards identified
in the non-compliant products include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Baby cots:</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entrapment: Having openings and moving
parts/sides that were wide enough to trap children’s fingers or head.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strangulation hazard: Having points where
clothes could get trapped and potentially cause strangulation.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fall hazards: Having bases that could
break easily and cause falls, or sides with insufficient height to prevent
children from climbing out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Strollers:</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fall hazards: Having frames or wheels
that broke while passing over uneven surfaces, or having inadequate restraint
systems, both of which could allow a child to fall out.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choking hazard: Having small and detachable
parts that could cause choking.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shearing and crushing hazards: Having
moving parts that could trap, pinch, or cut fingers or toes.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Children’s jewellery (including accessories):</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laceration hazards: Having ornaments that
detached during testing, exposing sharp points.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Button/cell battery ingestion hazard:
Watches having button battery compartments that were easily accessible
by children, which could cause chemical burns internally if swallowed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Refer to <strong>Annex A</strong> for the list of unsafe products and specific
safety hazards).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Safety incidents involving children’s products</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, safety
incidents involving the three categories of children’s products surveyed
by the CPSO have continued to occur. &nbsp;The National Trauma Registry<sup>[1]</sup> records
an average of about 140 cases of child injuries annually between 2022 and
2024 from the use of baby cots, strollers, button batteries and children’s
jewellery. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to KK Women's
and Children's Hospital ("<strong>KKH</strong>"), incidents of children's
injuries involving baby cots and strollers were primarily head injuries
from falls. Dr Ronald Tan, Senior Consultant, Department of Emergency Medicine,
KKH, and Chairman of the KKH Injury Prevention Working Group, noted: “We
have seen a rise in cot- and stroller-related injuries over the past five
years. This trend reminds us of the importance for parents and caregivers
to be present, exercise greater caution, and provide closer supervision
when using cots and strollers”.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ensuring product safety for children</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPSO notes that
most physical retailers in Singapore selling baby cots, strollers and toys
surveyed can produce supporting documents indicating that their products
had been tested to relevant safety requirements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Alvin Koh, Chief
Executive, CCS said: "Following our market surveillance efforts, we have
worked closely with the e-commerce platforms and online retailers to remove
these non-compliant products. Consumers who purchased the identified products
should stop using them immediately, and those with similar products should
be mindful of potential hazards. Consumers buying toys and children’s products
online must check the product listings for safety related instructions,
appropriate age labelling, and customer reviews. While we urge consumers
and parents to keep a watchful eye for risky products, CCS will continue
our market surveillance efforts to keep our consumers safe."</p>
<p></p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the CGSR, suppliers
of general consumer goods in Singapore must ensure their products meet
applicable safety standards. Children’s products must comply with applicable
international safety standards issued by at least one of the following
organisations: the International Organization for Standardization (<strong>ISO</strong>),
International Electrotechnical Commission (<strong>IEC</strong>), European
Committee for Standardisation (<strong>EN</strong>), or ASTM International.
Any person who fails to comply with the CPSO directions to stop selling
unsafe products, is liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding S$10,000
or imprisonment not exceeding two years, or both.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What should parents or caregivers do?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents and caregivers
play an important role in ensuring that children use safe products. The
following safety tips can serve as a reference when buying or using children’s
products (more product-specific safety tips can be found in <strong>Annex B</strong>):
<br>
<br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buy from authorised retailers or reputable brands/suppliers.
<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check online listings or product labels for age recommendations
and safety instructions.
<br>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compare reviews from reputable websites or
other sources to assess product quality and potential safety concerns.
<br>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before use, inspect the product for any unsafe parts
(e.g. presence of detachable small parts and sharp points/edges).
<br>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure that button or cell battery compartments are
properly secured and cannot be easily accessed by children during use.</p>
