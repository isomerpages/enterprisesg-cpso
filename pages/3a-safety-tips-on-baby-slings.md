## Safety Tips on Baby Slings
Made from fabrics and lightweight materials like cotton and linen, baby slings are becoming a popular and trendy choice for parents and caregivers to conveniently carry their babies. However, they should be aware that when used incorrectly, baby slings can cause suffocations or falls. The fabric can press against a baby’s nose and mouth, potentially causing breathing difficulties. The risk of suffocation is even higher for young infants because their neck muscles are weak and they are not able to move their faces away.

**Safety Tips**
* Read the age recommendations, safety warnings, and other instructions for use and follow them strictly.
* Check the sling for wear and tear, rips and other damage before each use. Do not use a damaged sling.
* Ask for assistance if you find it difficult to move your baby in or out of the sling, or need some time to adjust to its use.
* When bending forward, hold on to your baby to prevent him or her from falling out of the sling. Bending at the knees rather than the waist may also be safer.
* Do not carry your baby in a sling when cooking, drinking hot soup or beverages, jogging or riding a bicycle.
* Never leave your baby alone in the sling.
* Practice the following to prevent suffocations:
  * Be vigilant and check on your baby often to make sure that he or she is in a safe position.
  * Ensure that you can see your baby’s face at all times.
  * Keep your baby’s head upright and make sure he or she is able to breathe freely. Suffocation can occur in under a minute and babies may not be able to cry out for help or make obvious movements.
  * Make sure your baby’s chin is up and away from his or her body and not pressing against your body or the sling.
  * If you nurse your baby in the sling, ensure that his or her head is facing up after you are done.
  * Do not use a sling to carry your baby if he or she is unwell, has a cold or other breathing problems.
