## Safety Tips on Children Toys
A study conducted by KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital found that many parents are buying toys that are not age-appropriate for their children. This resulted in a 15% rise in toy-related injuries in children under the age of 5 in 2013, compared to the same period in 2012.

Some parents believed that the toy would benefit their child educationally and thought that their child was old enough to play with the toy safely.

You can protect your child from hazards like choking, falls, cuts and bruises by following the manufacturer’s recommendations and guidelines. Pay attention to the age-appropriateness of the toy and look out for labels such as this:

**"Dos"** <br>
1. Check if the toy is being recalled or banned. Read up on notices or alerts on any safety issues or potential hazards. You may refer [here](https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/consumers/product-safety-alerts-and-recalls/children-apparel).
2. Read safety labels carefully and follow the instructions for use.
3. Buy toys that are right for your child's age. Toys for older children should be kept out of reach of younger ones.
4. Follow age recommendations and other instructions on the product packaging closely. Do not buy the product if such information is not available.
5. Buy well-made toys complying with the appropriate Standard(s). A list of applicable Safety Standards can be found [here](https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/suppliers/cgsr/resources).
6. Check toys for any breakage which may result in sharp edges or other hazards. Damaged toys should be repaired or discarded.
7. Ensure that toys are kept properly to avoid being a tripping hazard.
8. Remove batteries in electronic toys when not in use. Batteries left in toys for a long time may leak poisonous fluid.
9. Only buy from reputable brands and sellers.
10. Ensure that toys with projectiles do not have sharp edges. Check that the toy cannot launch improvised projectiles such as pencils and other potentially dangerous items.
11. Ensure that riding toys are stable and will not topple easily

13. Seek medical attention immediately if child swallows a battery
