## Safety Tips on Children Toys
A study conducted by KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital found that many parents are buying toys that are not age-appropriate for their children. This resulted in a 15% rise in toy-related injuries in children under the age of 5 in 2013, compared to the same period in 2012.

Parents believed that the toy would benefit their child educationally and thought that their child was old enough to play with the toy safely.

You can protect your child from hazards like choking, falls, cuts and bruises by following the manufacturer’s recommendations and guidelines. Pay attention to the age-appropriateness of the toy and look out for labels such as this:

*Before purchase:*
* Ensure that the toy you are buying is appropriate for your child’s age. Toys for older children should be kept out of the reach of younger ones.
* Test toys, especially electronic ones, before buying. Ask for a demonstration before deciding if the toy is safe for your child.
* Follow age recommendations and other instructions on the product packaging closely. Do not buy the product if such information is not available.
* Buy from reputable brands and sellers.
* When buying toys with projectiles, ensure that the projectiles do not have sharp edges. Make sure that the toy cannot launch improvised projectiles, such as pencils, that are potentially dangerous.
* Small button batteries that are commonly used in electronic toys can cause serious internal injuries or death if swallowed. Make sure that the battery compartment can be safely secured.

*During use:*
* Read safety labels carefully.
* Warn children of dangers such as the swallowing or choking on small parts.
* Supervise children when they are playing with toys, especially those with projectiles that can cause injuries on impact.
* Check your children’s toys regularly for damage. Teach your children to inform you when a toy needs repair or is broken. Broken toys may cause injuries.
* Ensure that toys are stowed away properly after play.
* Remove the batteries in electronic toys when they are not in use. Batteries that are left unused for a long time may leak harmful chemicals.
* Seek medical attention immediately if a child swallows a battery.
