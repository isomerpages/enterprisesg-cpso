<h2>Safety Tips on Purchasing and Using Decorative Lighting</h2>
<p>Decorative lighting helps brighten the festive mood and adds a splash
of colour to our home. However, their improper use can cause injuries and
fires.</p>
<p>Decorative incandescent lighting is one of the 33 categories of Controlled
Goods under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations.
For your own safety, please ensure that decorative lighting chains bear
the SAFETY Mark before purchase. The SAFETY Mark indicates that the product
model has been tested to specific safety standards and also carries a unique
certification number traceable to the supplier.</p>

<p>Here are some other safety considerations to keep in mind when purchasing
or using decorative light chains:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Avoid using indoor lighting outside the house as the wire insulation may
not be able to withstand wet or windy weather. Inspect plug and lamp holders
to make sure there are no exposed wires or obvious damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unwind all extensions to avoid overheating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety warnings. Ensure all
lights and extensions are used for their intended purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not alter or modify any lighting equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test decorative lights before installing them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always switch off the power when putting up decorative lights or changing
light bulbs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn off all lights and other decorations whenever you go to bed or leave
the house. Leaving lighting chains unattended for long periods of time
could potentially result in short circuits and fires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep lighting chains away from flammable objects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
