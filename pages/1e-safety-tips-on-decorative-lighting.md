## Safety Tips on Purchasing and Using Decorative Lighting
Decorative lighting helps brighten the festive mood and adds a splash of colour to our home. However, their improper use can cause injuries and fires.

Decorative incandescent lighting is one of the 33 categories of Controlled Goods under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations. For your own safety, please ensure that decorative lighting chains bear the SAFETY Mark before purchase. The SAFETY Mark indicates that the product model has been tested to specific safety standards and also carries a unique certification number traceable to the supplier.

Here are some other safety considerations to keep in mind when purchasing or using decorative light chains:
* Avoid using indoor lighting outside the house as the wire insulation may not be able to withstand wet or windy weather. Inspect plug and lamp holders to make sure there are no exposed wires or obvious damage.
* Unwind all extensions to avoid overheating.
* Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety warnings. Ensure all lights and extensions are used for their intended purposes.
* Do not alter or modify any lighting equipment.
* Test decorative lights before installing them.
* Always switch off the power when putting up decorative lights or changing light bulbs.
* Turn off all lights and other decorations whenever you go to bed or leave the house. Leaving lighting chains unattended for long periods of time could potentially result in short circuits and fires.
* Keep lighting chains away from flammable objects.
