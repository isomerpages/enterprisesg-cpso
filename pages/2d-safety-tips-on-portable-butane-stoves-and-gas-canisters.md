* Avoid using the stove in any way that traps heat.
  * Ensure that there is adequate air flow over the top and sides of the stove.
  * Do not use pans larger than those indicated in the instruction manual as they will concentrate heat back towards the gas canister, causing it to overheat and explode.
  * Avoid wrapping aluminium foil on or around the burner.

* Do not operate the stove longer than what is recommended by the manufacturer.
* Use the stove at a well-ventilated place.
* After use, remove the gas canister from the stove. Cap the valve of the canister and store it in a cool place, away from any flames. Do this even if the canister is empty.
* Do not tamper with the stove or attempt to repair a faulty stove yourself. Stop using the portable butane gas stove if it is not operating or igniting correctly.
* Avoid leaving a lit stove unattended or place flammable items nearby during use.
* If you smell a gas leak, put out all flames and turn off the stove, gas valves and regulators. Call your authorised dealer to report the leak immediately.
