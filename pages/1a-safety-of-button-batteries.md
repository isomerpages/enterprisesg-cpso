<h2>Safety Tips on Button Batteries</h2>
<p>Parents and caregivers must be aware of the dangers that button batteries
can pose to young children. These batteries are found in many common household
devices like remote controls, toys and flashlights. They should be kept
out of the reach of small children as they may be accidentally swallowed
or inserted into their ears or noses. Parents should get medical help fast
if these batteries are swallowed as they can get stuck in the throat and
cause severe burns.</p>
<p>According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the coin-sized
lithium button batteries can lodge in the throats of children, where saliva
immediately triggers an electrical current, causing a chemical reaction
that can severely burn through the oesophagus in as little as two hours.</p>
