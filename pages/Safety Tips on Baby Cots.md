## Safety Tips on Baby Cots
Babies spend a lot of time in cots and parents should look out for safety features when buying cots. Neglecting safety considerations or inappropriate use can have severe consequences.

Always follow the instructions provided in the manual and pay attention to warnings that will help prevent injuries.

**Safety Tips**

*Before purchase:*
* Check the stability of the baby cot in the shop before purchase and make sure it is stable. For example, apply a little pressure on the cot and assess if it is sturdy. 
*	When buying a cot, opt for one with a wide, sturdy and stable base and ensure that there are no loose parts. Always check for the stability of the cot before purchase or after you have put it together at home. If it wobbles or rattles, it may have been put together improperly.	
*	Ensure that there are no spaces between the sides of mattress and cot walls. This is to prevent baby from being trapped between the mattress and cot.
*	Proper assembly of the cot is of utmost importance. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully and make sure all the parts are put together correctly. If in doubt, consult the supplier.
*	Adhere to the product information on the maximum size and weight of babies suitable for the product to be used safely.
*	Ensure that the cot has no missing parts such as slats. Slats should be secure and spaced no more than 4.5 to 6 cm apart. This is to avoid your baby’s head slipping through and getting trapped.
*	Ensure that the cot has no broken, loose, missing or improperly installed brackets, screws or other hardware.
*	For swinging cradles, ensure that locking mechanisms or devices are in place. Ensure that the lock is activated once the baby has fallen asleep. 
*	Check mattress support often to ensure that it hasn’t come of the end panels.
*	Use a firm, snugly fitting mattress to prevent baby from being trapped between the mattress and crib.
*	Make sure the cot sheet fits well on the mattress. Check that it wraps around and fits securely at the mattress corners.
*	Bumper pads are padded pieces placed alongside of cribs to protect baby limps from slipping through the gaps found on side of cots. Use cot bumper pads cautiously as they could pose a risk of suffocation. It may also cause a lack of proper ventilation If it is not properly installed/placed. Ensure that there is proper air ventilation and regularly check on your baby. 
*	Do not place stuffed toys or pillows in the crib to reduce the risk of your baby suffocating or using them as a foothold to climb out of the crib.
*	Remove all  toys strung across the cot/playpen when your baby is able to stand to avoid being caught in them.
*	If your cot has a drop-side, inspect the mechanism regularly to ensure the joints are securely fastened.
*	Make sure the cot has no raised corner posts or cutouts as your baby’s clothing could get caught on them, posing a strangulation risk.
*	Regularly check that nuts and bolts are tight, as per the maintenance instructions supplied with the cot.
*	Put the drop side up when your baby is sleeping to prevent fall hazards.


*During use:*
* Never place a cot near a window with blinds, curtain cords, baby monitor cords, or wall mounted decorative accessories with long cords. Babies are at risk of strangling by the cords and older babies could pull themselves up and fall through the window.
* Do not use mattress or pads other than those provided by the manufacturer. Don’t put in extra mattresses, pillows or cushions.
*	Do not buy cots with corner posts with decorative knobs as there is a possibility of baby’s clothes getting caught on these.
*	Never put your baby on sofa cushions, adult beds or pillows or any surface not designed for infant sleep.
