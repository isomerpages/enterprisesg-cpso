## Safety Tips on Baby Cots
It is easy to just pick designs that are trendy or cute when buying jewellery for your young children. However, parents and caregivers should never overlook safety. Avoid accessories with small parts that can pose a choking hazard. Harmful metals can also be a concern, especially since young children tend to put things into their mouths.

**Safety Tips**

*Before purchase:*
* Read the age recommendations and product label. Parents should only buy age appropriate jewellery as the product may come with small accessories which can pose a choking hazard.
* For necklaces, consider those that come with breakaway features and releases to prevent strangulation hazard.
* Inspect the product for small parts and/or sharp edges.
* For battery operated accessories, check and ensure the battery compartments are secure and cannot be easily opened by a young child.
* Buy from reputable sources and stores. Ask if safety requirements have been met.

*During use:*
* Make sure your children do not place jewellery into their mouths.
* If your children have the tendency to put objects in their mouths, do not give them metal chains or pendants to wear. Metals like lead, cadmium or nickel tend to leach out when chewed or swallowed.
