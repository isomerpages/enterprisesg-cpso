<h2>Safety Tips on Hair Straighteners</h2>
<p>Hair straighteners generate high heat which can be applied to hair to
smoothen out tangles. It is important to know that the heat generated can
reach temperatures exceeding 200°C. While they heat up rapidly, a considerable
amount of time is needed for the appliance to cool down after use. If they
are not put away safely during the cooling down process, there is a risk
of contact burns from the hot plates when young children pick them up.
This could result in injuries ranging from the superficial to the severe.</p>
<p>Keep your family safe – follow these safety guidelines and exercise caution
when using hair straighteners:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Only purchase hair straighteners bearing the SAFETY Mark. The SAFETY Mark
indicates that the product model has been tested to specific safety standards,
and also carries a unique certification number traceable to the supplier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch off hair straighteners immediately after use. Do not leave it running
unattended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep hair straighteners out of reach of children while waiting for the
plates to cool down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store them in a safe place immediately after the plates have cooled down.
If possible, place them in a special heat resistant pouch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not use electrical appliances near bathtubs, basins or other vessels
containing water.</p>
</li>
</ul>
