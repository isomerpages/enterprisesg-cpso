## Safety Tips on Highchairs
When it comes to the use of highchairs, adult/parental supervision is as important as ensuring the product is compliant with safety standards. We encourage consumers to be vigilant and supervise your child when using the product. Children should not be allowed to climb into or stand on highchairs. Do not place highchairs near furniture in such a way that allows the child to push against them to cause the highchair to tip over.

Following are additional safety tips for parents and caregivers regarding the purchase and use of highchairs:

**Stability**<br>
•	Check the stability of the highchair to make sure it is stable. For example, apply some weight on the seat and backrest to see if it squeaks, sags, moves out of position or collapses. Exert a push and pull force on each side of the highchair (front, rear, left, right) to assess if it is stable.<br>
•	If the highchair has castors fitted, ensure that at least one pair of castors (either front or back) has brakes to keep the highchair stable and in place.

**Restraint system**<br>
•	Always use the safety straps and adjust them to fit the child snugly.<br>
•	Check that the highchair’s restraint system contains one of the following:<br>
* Minimally, a waist restraint and crotch restraint system such that the crotch restraint’s use is mandatory when the restraint system is in use; or<br>
* A crotch restraint with a horizontal element that creates an opening for the child’s legs. The openings must not be too large such that it is possible for a child to fall through the opening; or<br>
* The waist restraint must be adjustable to the size of the child and must not move or slip easily.

**Openings**<br>
•	Check that the openings on either side of the crotch restraint are not so large as to allow a child’s torso to pass through the opening. The maximum recommended dimension of the opening on each side of the crotch restraint should not exceed 140mm x 108mm x 25mm.<br>
•	Check that the vertical gap between the crotch restraint and the front torso support is not large enough for a child’s leg to pass through. The height of the vertical gap should not exceed 38mm.<br>
•	When the highchair is in the most upright position with the back rest in a position furthest away from the crotch restraint, check that the opening between the back rest and crotch restraint is not so large as to allow the child to climb out of the highchair. The maximum recommended distance is 216mm when measured horizontally.

**Front torso support or tray**<br>
•	Check that moving parts cannot pinch, crush or trap a child’s finger, toe, limb or head, and that there are no sharp points, sharp edges and small parts present along the edges of the chair, on the front torso support/ tray that could cut a child.<br>
•	If the front torso support/tray is removable, check that it is not easily dislocated from its position. For example, exert a pull force from each direction on the tray and assess that it is not dislocated or dislodged from its position.<br>
•	Do not use the tray to hold the child in the highchair. Instead, use the restraints attached to the highchair.<br>

**Latching or locking mechanism**<br>
•	For highchairs that are foldable, check that there are latching or locking devices that will prevent the highchair from folding during normal use. In order to prevent unintentional folding, these devices should not be deactivated easily by a small amount of force.
