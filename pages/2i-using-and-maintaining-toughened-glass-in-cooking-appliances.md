<h2>Safety tips on Toughened Glass in Cooking Appliances</h2>
<p><strong>Where can you find toughened glass?</strong>
<br>Toughened glass (also known as tempered glass) is used in a variety of
consumer products, ranging from windshields to cooking appliances like
gas hobs.</p>
<p>Gas hobs are regulated by the <a href="/about/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPSO</a> under the <a href="/suppliers/cpsr/overview-of-cpsr" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations</a>.
Gas hobs must be tested to specified safety standards and affixed with
the SAFETY Mark before they can be sold in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Why does the toughened glass in gas hobs shatter?</strong>
<br>In many cases, the main reason the glass shatters is due to tiny hairline
cracks that form as a result of accidental damage. These hairline cracks
tend to widen over time due to expansion and contraction caused by cycles
of heating and cooling as the appliance is switched on and off during use.
This continues until the glass eventually shatters.</p>
<p>Hairline cracks can also develop when hard objects such as pots and pans
are placed too forcefully onto the jobs' toughened glass surface.</p>
<p><strong>Safety tips for using and maintaining toughened glass</strong>
<br>In general, you should practice the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Buy registered electrical and gas appliancs bearing the SAFETY Mark. Learn
more about the SAFETY Mark and how to check if your electrical or gas appliance
is a registered Controlled Good <a href="/consumers/choose-safer-products/look-for-the-safety-mark" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ensure installation, repair and servicing of gas hobs is carried out by
qualified service personnel. You can do this by:

<p>Prevent the glass surface of the gas hob from overheating.

<p><strong>What to do if toughened glass shatters</strong>
<br>If the toughened glass on your gas hob shatters, you should:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Remain calm. While shattering may cause a loud cracking noise, the glass
will crumble into small rounded pieces which are less likely to cause injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photograph the damaged appliance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clean up glass fragments and keep them out of reach of childern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report the indicident to the manufacturer of the appliance. Provide the
following information when reporting the incident:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
<li>
<p>Model number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Date of purchase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Description of incident (e.g. time of incident, activity prior to shattering
of glass etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of purchase (e.g. receipt, warranty card)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photos of the damaged appliance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your contact details</p>
</li>
</ul>
