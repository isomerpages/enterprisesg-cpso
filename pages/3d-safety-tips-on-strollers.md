## Safety Tips on Strollers
Strollers are a convenient way to bring your child around with you. When buying one, look beyond style and comfort to also consider whether it is safe for your child. Neglecting safety considerations or inappropriate use can have severe consequences.

Always follow the instructions provided in the manual and pay attention to warnings that will help prevent injuries.

**Safety Tips**

*Before purchase:*
* Ensure that the stroller is suitable for the age and weight of your child.
* Some strollers are not suitable for newborns who cannot hold up their heads. You should also look out for strollers that fit your child's height comfortably or that come with adjustable handlebars.
* Look out for brakes that are easy to operate. Do not purchase a stroller if it moves even when the brakes are applied.
* Ensure that the stroller has a 2-step locking system or a multi-lock system in place to prevent it from collapsing accidentally while in use.
* Make sure there are no sharp edges or protruding parts that may injure your child.
* Check that there are no openings at the side or bottom that your child can slip through.

*During use:*
* Ensure that your child is at a safe distance away when unfolding or folding the stroller.
* Check that the stroller is fully set up and all locking devices are engaged before use.
* Avoid hanging heavy items from the handlebars to prevent the stroller from accidentally tipping over. Place items in the basket beneath the stroller. Do not exceed the maximum permissible load of the stroller.
* When using a stroller with a harness, check that your child cannot unbuckle the harness.
* After your child is secured in the harness, ensure that there are no straps or cords that can pose a strangulation hazard.
* Do not leave your child unattended. Ensure that the brakes are engaged when the stroller is not in motion.
