<h2>Type of Mains Plugs Suitable for use in Singapore</h2>
<p>Apart from Brunei, Hong Kong, Malaysia or the UK, mains plugs that are
used in other countries are different from those intended for use in Singapore.
It is important to ensure that the correct plug is used with a local wall
socket to avoid hazards such as fires and electrocution.</p>
<p><strong>3 types of mains plugs suitable for use in Singapore</strong>

<p><strong>(1) The 2.5AMP 2 round-pin mains plug</strong> – This is generally
used for electronics appliances such as TV, DVD and audio sets. These appliances
do not rely on the ‘Earth’ wire for protection from a short circuit and
therefore only 2 pins are needed – one for the ‘Live’ wire and the other
for the ‘Neutral’ wire.</p>

<p><strong>(2) The 13AMP 3 pin fused mains plug</strong> – This is used for
electrical appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and microwave
ovens. These appliances have a metal body which must be grounded so that
in the event of a short circuit, there is no risk of electrocution to the
user.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>(3) The 15AMP 3 round-pin mains plug</strong> – This is used generally
for air-conditioners.</p>
<p>The 13AMP and 15AMP mains plugs are controlled goods under the Consumer
Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations. They must be affixed with
the SAFETY Mark which carries a unique certification number traceable to
the supplier. When purchasing a mains-powered electric appliance, always
ensure that its mains plug carries a SAFETY Mark.</p>
<p><strong>Caution: Schuko plugs</strong>

<p>Some appliances are fitted with mains plugs meant for the German market.
These are <strong>rated at 10/16AMP</strong> and known as <strong>‘Schuko’</strong> plugs
(<em>see image</em>). This type of mains plug is <strong>not suitable for use in Singapore</strong>.
The dimension of the round pins will stress the contacts of the mains socket
outlet, subsequently leading to poor contact and overheating.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while ‘Schuko’ plugs may come with earthing strips located
on their sides, they are not safe for use in Singapore as the earthing
strips cannot make contact with the earth contact of a local mains socket.</p>
