<h3>Type of Mains Plugs Suitable for use in Singapore</h3>
<p>Some countries that use the same type of mains plugs as Singapore include
Brunei, Hong Kong, Malaysia or the UK. However, there are countries that
use other types of mains plugs that may not be suitable for use in Singapore.
It is important to ensure that the correct plug is used with a local wall
socket to avoid hazards such as fires and electrocution.</p>
<p><strong>Types of mains plugs suitable for use in Singapore</strong>

<p><strong>13-ampere (A) 3-pin fused mains plug (or Type G plug)</strong>&nbsp;–
This is suitable for most electrical appliances in Singapore, but particularly
important for those with metal bodies, such as refrigerators, washing machines
and microwave ovens. Appliances with metal bodies should be grounded through
the plug’s earthing pin to reduce the risk of electrocution to the user
in the event of a short circuit.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>15A 3 round-pin mains plug</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(or Type M plug) </strong>–
This is generally used by energy-intensive appliances such as air-conditioners
which require more electrical current than the standard 13A Type G plug
can safely provide. Take note that the installation of corresponding 15A
Type M socket outlets should only be carried out by qualified electrical
workers.</p>
<p>When purchasing mains-powered electrical appliances for use in Singapore,
the Consumer Product Safety Office recommends looking out for those with
13A Type G plugs for most electrical appliances. For more energy-intensive
electrical appliances that require higher power consumption, consumers
should check with the supplier on whether the 15A Type M plug is required,
and if so, what are the associated installation requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, 13A and 15A mains plugs are controlled goods under the Consumer
Protection (Safety Requirements) Regulations. They must be affixed with
the <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/consumers/choose-safer-products/look-for-the-safety-mark/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SAFETY Mark</a> which
carries a unique certification number traceable to the supplier. Consumers
should always ensure that their appliances’ 3-pin mains plug carries a
SAFETY Mark.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>2.5A 2 round-pin mains plug (or Type C plug)</strong>&nbsp;– This
is generally used for low-power appliances (e.g., TV, DVD, and audio sets)
that are designed with internal safety features, such as double insulation,
that provide sufficient protection against leakage current. &nbsp;Such
appliances do not rely on the ‘Earth’ wire for protection from a short
circuit and only 2 pins are needed – one for the ‘Live’ wire and the other
for the ‘Neutral’ wire.</p>
<p>Consumers should use suitable adaptors (e.g. fused conversion plugs) to
safely connect 2.5A 2-pin plugs to 3-pin mains socket outlets. Do not force
the 2-pin plug into a 3-pin socket without a proper adaptor.</p>
<p><strong>Caution: Schuko plugs</strong>

<p>Some appliances are fitted with mains plugs meant for the German market.
These are&nbsp;<strong>rated at 10A/16A</strong>&nbsp;and known as&nbsp;<strong>Schuko</strong>&nbsp;plugs
(see image). This type of mains plug is&nbsp;<strong>not suitable for use in Singapore</strong>.
The dimension of the round pins will stress the contacts of the mains socket
outlet, subsequently leading to poor contact and overheating.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while Schuko plugs may come with earthing strips located
on their sides, they are not safe for use in Singapore as the earthing
strips cannot make contact with the earth contact of a local mains socket.</p>
