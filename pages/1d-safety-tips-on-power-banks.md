<h2>Safety Tips on Power Banks</h2>
<p>Power banks are generally rechargeable lithium-ion or lithium-polymer
batteries that are used to provide a portable source of power for electronic
devices. Although generally considered safe, they can catch fire or cause
burns if they malfunction.</p>

<p><strong>Understand the product</strong>
</p>
<p>Before buying a product, ask questions like:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Does this power bank come with operating and safety instructions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I charge the power bank?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I charge my device with the power bank?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the different ports indicated clearly?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of cables and chargers can I use? Are these supplied with the
power bank or do I have to use my own?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can I tell when the power bank is fully charged?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much time is needed for a full charge?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What will happen if the power bank is fully charged but still connected
to the charging source? Is there automatic power-off?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What safety features does this power bank come with?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What safety testing and certification information is available?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Safety protection features</strong>
</p>
<p>Look for power banks that come with safety protection features, such as
over-charge protection, short-circuit protection, over-temperature or over-heat
protection, over-current protection or over-voltage protection.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions for use</strong>
</p>
<p>Always read operating and safety instructions as well as understand how
the power bank should be used. Take note of warnings and avoid mishandling
the product.</p>
<p><strong>Who is the manufacturer?</strong>
</p>
<p>Consider a trusted brand and buy a power bank that comes with a warranty.
Find out if there is an authorised service centre that you can contact
in the event of any product-related issue or incident.</p>
<p><strong>False representation</strong>
</p>
<p>Take note that certain power banks have been incorrectly advertised as
“SPRING Singapore approved” or “Enterprise Singapore approved”. Please
note that Enterprise Singapore (previously SPRING Singapore) does not require
a registration or approval process for power banks. Suppliers are to ensure
that power banks meet the relevant safety requirements before they are
sold in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Some Dos and Don’ts</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Charging</strong>: Avoid leaving your power bank on prolonged
charge as this may cause it to overheat. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines
on the time required to fully charge your power bank. If the power bank
becomes excessively hot during charging or discharging, unplug it from
the power source or your mobile device immediately. Avoid charging the
power bank on places that build up heat, such as on your bed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid short circuits</strong>: Keep your power bank away from
metal objects such as coins, paper clips and keys. Do not insert any metal
objects into the USB output port or joining terminals of the power bank.
Short circuits may present risks of excessive heat, fire or explosion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage</strong>: Keep the power bank in a cool and dry place
away from heat sources, moisture and dust. Avoid leaving the power bank
in places with high temperature such as cars parked under the sun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid applying excessive force on the power bank or dropping the power bank</strong>:
By doing so, it may damage the internal components of the power bank and
risk short circuiting the device when used. Always inspect the power bank
and refrain from using it if leakage, strange odours, colour changes, deformation
or any unusual occurrences are detected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not allow children to use and play with the power bank.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
