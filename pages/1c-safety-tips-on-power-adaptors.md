## Safety Tips on Power Adaptors
Power adaptors are also generally referred to as AC adapters, AC/DC adapters or chargers. They are plugged into the mains power supply and convert the mains electricity voltage to the lower voltage required to power electrical appliances, such as computers, mobile telecommunication devices, home entertainment equipment and toys.

Here are some tips to help ensure you enjoy safe and long-lasting use of your electrical appliances and electronic devices.

**Look out for the SAFETY Mark**

Power adapters are one of the 33 categories of Controlled Goods under the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Registration Scheme, and are therefore required to carry the SAFETY Mark.

Always check that adapters carry the SAFETY Mark before purchase. The SAFETY Mark indicates that the product has been tested to specific safety standards, and also carries a unique certification number traceable to the supplier. Adapters without the SAFETY Mark may lack the proper safeguards to prevent short circuits, fires, and electrocutions.

**Purchase power adapters from the product manufacturer**

This ensures that the power adapter is compatible with your product. While adapters may look similar visually, their internal circuitry can differ greatly.

Poor power adaptor design may also result in low power output. This may affect the efficiency of the power supply which can in turn damage the product connected to the adapter.

**Safety tips when using power adapters**
* Do not handle power adapters with wet hands.
* Keep power adapters away from moisture to prevent short circuits.
* When using power adapters to charge mobile devices, avoid using the device when they are plugged into the mains.
* Always use adapters with a power output that is suitable for your product. Failure to do so may damage your product, leading to hazards such as short circuits, fires, and electrocutions.
