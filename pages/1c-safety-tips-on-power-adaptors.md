<h2>Safety Tips on Power Adaptors</h2>
<p>Power adaptors are also generally referred to as AC adapters, AC/DC adapters
or chargers. They are plugged into the mains power supply and convert the
mains electricity voltage to the lower voltage required to power electrical
appliances, such as computers, mobile telecommunication devices, home entertainment
equipment and toys.</p>

<p>Here are some tips to help ensure you enjoy safe and long-lasting use
of your electrical appliances and electronic devices.</p>
<p><strong>Look out for the SAFETY Mark</strong>
</p>
<p>Power adapters are one of the 33 categories of Controlled Goods under
the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Registration Scheme, and
are therefore required to carry the SAFETY Mark.</p>
<p>Always check that adapters carry the SAFETY Mark before purchase. The
SAFETY Mark indicates that the product has been tested to specific safety
standards, and also carries a unique certification number traceable to
the supplier. Adapters without the SAFETY Mark may lack the proper safeguards
to prevent short circuits, fires, and electrocutions.</p>
<p><strong>Purchase power adapters from the product manufacturer</strong>
</p>
<p>This ensures that the power adapter is compatible with your product. While
adapters may look similar visually, their internal circuitry can differ
greatly.</p>
<p>Poor power adaptor design may also result in low power output. This may
affect the efficiency of the power supply which can in turn damage the
product connected to the adapter.</p>
<p><strong>Safety tips when using power adapters</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do not handle power adapters with wet hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep power adapters away from moisture to prevent short circuits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using power adapters to charge mobile devices, avoid using the device
when they are plugged into the mains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use adapters with a power output that is suitable for your product.
Failure to do so may damage your product, leading to hazards such as short
circuits, fires, and electrocutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
