<h2>Safety Tips on Lithium-Ion Batteries</h2>
<p>Lithium-ion batteries are often used in consumer electronic devices and
household appliances, including mobile phones, laptops, and vacuum cleaners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While these batteries are convenient, they can overheat or explode if
incorrectly used, charged or are damaged. Lithium-ion battery fires can
be hard to extinguish and dangerous.</p>

<p>Before purchasing, check if the device has been recalled in any region.
Visit the <a href="https://www.consumerproductsafety.gov.sg/consumers/safety-alerts-and-recalls/electrical/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CPSO's website</a> for
product safety alerts and recall notifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that the device's AC adaptor (aka charger) has a valid SAFETY Mark.
You may verify the validity by searching for the SAFETY Mark number, as
well as the device's brand or model in the <a href="https://www.cpsaplus.gov.sg/Homepage/RegisterOfRegisteredControlledGoods" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CPSO's public registry</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>Only use the manufacturerâ€™s recommended charger and battery for the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the manufacturer's instructions for charging the device and the
associated lithium-ion battery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not use damaged batteries, and never modify or tamper with the device's
battery. Do not charge devices which have lithium-ion batteries that are
suspected to be damaged, e.g. bloated or swollen battery, signs of chemical
leakage, and batteries that feel excessively hot during charging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor products while charging and unplug when the battery is fully charged
to prevent overcharging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never charge your device under your pillow, bed, or couch, which may restrict
airflow and potentially cause overheating and fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid dropping or applying excessive force to the device, which may damage
the internal components and pose a risk of short-circuiting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep devices and batteries away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and
moisture.</p>

<li>
<p>If any abnormalities are detected, stop using the device and seek assistance
from the authorised distributor/ service provider on repair, replacement
or disposal steps.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Dispose</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do not dispose of any batteries into general bins or blue recycling bins
as that may create fire hazards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tape the ends or wires of rechargeable batteries and seal any leaking
batteries in a leak-proof container or bag before recycling them. This
reduces the risk of short circuits and fire hazards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Singapore, the National Environment Agency (NEA) provides e-waste recycling
programmes for individuals and households. You may drop off your e-waste
at designated recycling points to ensure proper recycling.</p>
