<p>When considering which type of window coverings to buy, do ensure that
the product does not pose a safety hazard to your children. Loose cords
may pose a strangulation hazard to young children.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Tips</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Before purchase:</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
<li>
<p>Read warning labels to find out if the product poses any dangers to young
children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your product comes with cords, check that safety devices like tension
devices and cleats are included:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tension devices keep cords taut, preventing children from wrapping them
around their necks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleats secure cords on the wall, keeping them out of reach of children.</p>

<p><strong>Safety warnings</strong>: Read all warnings and follow the manufacturer’s
usage instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loose cords</strong>: Ensure that there are no loose accessible
cords on the front, side or back of the product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure any cords</strong> onto the wall using safety devices such
as a cleat or install a tension device</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Children’s furniture</strong>: Do not place cribs, beds, play
pens and other furniture close to a window because children can climb on
them and gain access to the cords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supervise</strong>: Always supervise children in any rooms where
the cords of window coverings are within reach.</p>
