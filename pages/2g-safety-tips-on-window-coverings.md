## Safety Tips on Window Coverings
Window blinds are becoming an increasingly popular type of window covering not just to block out sunlight, but also to provide privacy and an aesthetic appeal when used in home decoration.

When considering which type of window coverings to buy, do ensure that the product does not pose a safety hazard to your children. Loose cords may pose a strangulation hazard to young children.

**Safety Tips**

*Before purchase:*
* Select window coverings with safe design features:
  * Choose window coverings without exposed cords if you have young children at home. You may consider cordless window coverings instead.

  * Read warning labels to find out if the product poses any dangers to young children.
  * If your product comes with cords, check that safety devices like tension devices and cleats are included:
    * Tension devices keep cords taut, preventing children from wrapping them around their necks.
    * Cleats secure cords on the wall, keeping them out of reach of children.

*During Use:*
* **Safety warnings**: Read all warnings and follow the manufacturer’s usage instructions.
* **Loose cords**: Ensure that there are no loose accessible cords on the front, side or back of the product.
* **Secure any cords** onto the wall using safety devices such as a cleat or install a tension device
* **Children’s furniture**: Do not place cribs, beds, play pens and other furniture close to a window because children can climb on them and gain access to the cords.
* **Supervise**: Always supervise children in any rooms where the cords of window coverings are within reach.
