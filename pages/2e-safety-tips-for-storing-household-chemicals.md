## Safety Tips for Storing Household Chemicals
Consumers are advised to ensure that household products containing hazardous chemicals are properly stored. Many products found at home can be harmful if swallowed or come into contact with the skin or eyes.
* Household bleach
* Kitchen, floor, bathroom, furniture and glass cleaners
* Multi-purpose and all-purpose cleaners
* Fabric softeners as well as laundry and dishwashing detergents
* Insecticides and pesticides
* Air fresheners

**Safety Tips**

*General*:
* Read the product label and take note of dangers that the chemical may pose.
* Do not reuse empty containers or repack chemicals into other containers. Other containers may not be made with materials that can safely store chemicals. If not properly labelled, it may lead to mistaken use or accidental consumption.
* Help your children understand the dangers of chemicals and the importance of proper use and handling.
* Consider [Green Label](https://www.sgls.sec.org.sg/sgls-standard.php){:target="_blank"} certified products that have been tested to meet specific environmental and health prerequisites such as reduced toxicity and biodegradability.

*During use*:
* Follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions when using household chemicals. This may include adequate ventilation, use of safety gloves or goggles, etc.
* Do not leave chemicals unattended during use. This may unintentionally expose your children to danger.
* Store chemicals in a cabinet which cannot be reached by children and keep it locked at all times. They often come in brightly coloured packaging that look attractive to children who may mistake them for food or drinks.
