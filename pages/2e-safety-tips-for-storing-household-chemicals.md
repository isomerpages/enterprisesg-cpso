certified products that have been tested to meet specific environmental
and health prerequisites such as reduced toxicity and biodegradability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>During use</em>:</p>

<p>Follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using household chemicals.
This may include adequate ventilation, use of safety gloves or goggles,
etc.</p>

that look attractive to children who may mistake them for food or drinks.</p>
