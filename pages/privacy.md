### **Government of Singapore Privacy Statement**

1. &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a Government of Singapore digital service.

2. &nbsp; &nbsp; If you are only browsing this website, we do not capture data that allows us to identify you individually.

3. &nbsp; &nbsp; We may use “cookies”, where a small data file is sent to your browser to store and track information about you when you enter our digital service. The cookie is used to track information such as the number of users and their frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred digital service. While this cookie can tell us when you enter our digital service and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk.

4. &nbsp; &nbsp; You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the digital service.

5. &nbsp; &nbsp; If you provide us with personally identifiable data:
&nbsp; &nbsp; a. Where appropriate, we may share necessary data with other Government agencies to improve the discharge of public functions, and to serve you in the most efficient and effective way unless such sharing is prohibited by law.

&nbsp; &nbsp; b. We will NOT share your personal data with non-Government entities, except where such entities have been authorised to carry out specific Government services.

&nbsp; &nbsp; c. For your convenience, we may also display to you data you had previously supplied us or other Government Agencies. This will speed up the transaction and save you the trouble of repeating previous submissions. Should the data be out-of-date, please supply us the latest data.
