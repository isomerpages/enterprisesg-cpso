<h2>Safety Tips on Small Magnets</h2>
<p>Parents and caregivers are advised to be careful when letting children
handle products with small magnets. These can be life threatening when
accidentally swallowed.</p>
<p>Small, strong magnets are also increasingly being used in novelty items.
Young children may mistake these colourful magnets for candy and swallow
them. Children may also be attracted to fridge magnets that are made to
look like food.</p>
<p>The danger arises when more than one magnet is swallowed over a short
period of time. The magnets may get attracted to each other while travelling
through the body and can damage intestinal walls as well as cause infection,
blood poisoning and even death. When magnets are swallowed, emergency surgery
is usually required.</p>
