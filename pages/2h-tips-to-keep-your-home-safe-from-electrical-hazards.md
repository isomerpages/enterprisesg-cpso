<h2>Tips to Keep your Home Safe from Electrical Hazards</h2>
<p>We use a variety of electrical appliances in our everyday lives when we
clean or cook. Overlooking basic electrical safety practices can lead to
accidents, injuries, fires, and even deaths. Keep the following tips in
mind to safeguard your family from electrical hazards.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Many household items require a SAFETY Mark to indicate they comply with
specific safety requirements before they can be sold locally. Check if
an appliance requires a SAFETY Mark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always follow the appliance’s installation and user manuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that your electrical appliance is first switched off, before unplugging
it from the mains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When connecting or disconnecting electrical appliances, hold the plug
instead of the cord to prevent damage to the cord, which could expose the
live wires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your appliance has damaged or frayed cords, stop using it immediately
and get the cords replaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overloading wall socket outlets can cause fire hazards. Consider installing
additional ones if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always engage a licensed electrical worker to perform all electrical installation,
maintenance and repair work. Make sure to check the worker’s credentials.</p>

circuits. Do not handle electrical appliances with wet hands.</p>

<p>Keep heating appliances, such as kettles and irons, out of the reach of
children.</p>

service personnel. The appliance manufacturer should be able to provide
recommendations.</p>
