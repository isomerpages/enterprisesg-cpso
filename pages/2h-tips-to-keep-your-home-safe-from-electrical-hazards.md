## Tips to Keep your Home Safe from Electrical Hazards
We use a variety of electrical appliances in our everyday lives when we clean or cook. Overlooking basic electrical safety practices can lead to accidents, injuries, fires, and even deaths. Keep the following tips in mind to safeguard your family from electrical hazards.
* Many household items require a SAFETY Mark to indicate they comply with specific safety requirements before they can be sold locally. Check if an appliance requires a SAFETY Mark.
* Always follow the appliance’s installation and user manuals.
* Ensure that your electrical appliance is first switched off, before unplugging it from the mains.
* When connecting or disconnecting electrical appliances, hold the plug instead of the cord to prevent damage to the cord, which could expose the live wires.
* If your appliance has damaged or frayed cords, stop using it immediately and get the cords replaced.
* Overloading wall socket outlets can cause fire hazards. Consider installing additional ones if needed.
* Always engage a licensed electrical worker to perform all electrical installation, maintenance and repair work. Make sure to check the worker’s credentials.
* Keep liquids away from appliances and wall socket outlets to prevent short circuits. Do not handle electrical appliances with wet hands.
* Keep heating appliances, such as kettles and irons, out of the reach of children.
* Ensure installation and maintenance of appliances are carried out by qualified service personnel. The appliance manufacturer should be able to provide recommendations.
* If you suspect your appliance is malfunctioning, get qualified service personnel to inspect the item.
